I have a no brainer. Falling over
"To my knowledge, not a single cnidarian has a brain. Cnidaria's a phylum that contains sea jellies, sea anemones, hydras, coral, and more. Not a single animal from the phylum porifera has a brain, either. Porifera contains all sea sponges.

If you don't recall biology class, the taxonomy of life goes:
Kingdom
* Phylum *
Class
Order
Family
Genus
Species

Basically, phylums are huge. Even vertebrata, which consists of all animals with spines, is a subphylum, not all full-on phylum. In short, a gigantic amount of animals don't have a centralized nervous system. It's sad that Vsauce decided to present his extremely biased views instead of asking a sea sponge or a comb jelly what it's like. I've lost a lot of respect for him. It makes me wonder what other hidden biases he may harbor..."
Number 3: make tik tok videos
I can start a youtube channel and call it Vsauce

This feels so modern I forget its from 2012
"In the Hinduism they say, after you're dead , you lives in a form of ""pakage of tendencies"" a data form that don't have any command on actions and just floats according to it's inertia. Like a train without engine . Then it may stay in good ,ecstatic states told as ""heaven"" or disturbing ,uncomfortable states ""hell"" or you return as a life again and you don't decide it it's all your tendencies made in lifetime drives this form to the next stage. 
which makes me wonder like : a person who was desperate about heaven all his life, will be in desperation and wondering after death.
and maybe an aethist who tried to fulfil his life in this lifetime will reach a peaceful state after death coz there were no expectations. 

I arrived at the conclusion : living this moment properly will be good for this life. And for myself without ""My brain or Will""  in the timeless and unknown."
I think involuntry muscle dont require brain for their work so they will still do their work without the command of the brain

"It's not a ""no-brainer,""  it's a ""no frontal-lober."""
"Fun fact. Take care of adults with disabilities and ive taken care of someone who was born without a brain. She's 30 now. Still alive :) she is able to do so because of her brain stem. And its just fascinating seeing in person what it looks like to live without a brain. She reacts to all sorts of things. She can feel water temperatures, pain, she reacts to bright things like the sun even though she can't see. She sleeps and she is awake a lot of the time. She makes noises that reflect how she's doing, so say her tummy hurts she will whine a lot, she will smile at certain things like warm water or when she is around other people, ect. Now none of this means that she can see, feel, move, or have emotions, but there is a certain aspect about her that is hard to study because of how rare she is. She's pretty badass if you ask me."

"Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?
Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, ""Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.""

Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.

So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?

Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll pr- they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.

Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night."

Well let’s see here, based on executions which involved removing the head. The biggest thing you can do is die. You can also have seizures, muscle spasms. You can crawl. But of course this is just your body basically saying, what the fuck is happening my brain is gone. It’s not voluntary."

conclusion : shitting is a no brainer
What is a person? It's not just Flesh and blood. But a spirit which is our breath and our Soul which is our thoughts and Conscious. And we will all one day give an account for our thoughts and actions whether good or Bad when we leave these bodies and stand before the Lord. And we will certainly be found Guilty unless we are washed in the Blood of Jesus. For the preaching of the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation but to the Foolish Nonsense. I for one Know Jesus if you ask Him to forgive you He will. However we should also Love and forgive one another or else on that Day of judgement He will say I forgave you all your trespasses shouldn't you have had compassion even as I had compassion  on you when I forgave you? Then He will say take this wicked servant and cast him out. So Love and Forgive each other just as Jesus forgave you. That is walking is the Spirit of Love for God is Love. 1st John Ch 4 says God is Love and the way to Love is Being Kind Gentle meek patient Longsuffering forgiving merciful these are the ways to show Love not just to those who Love you but to those who hate you after all God is Also good to the wicked and we should do the same.

In 1945 farmer lloyd olsen went out to grab a chicken for supper. he cut the chicken's head off... and it didnt die. mile the headless chicken lived for another 18 months, he toured the ciuntry and surprise onlookers, he could wlsk and perch and was fed bu putting little drops of water or pieces of grain fown his theoat. but heres the thing, mike the hesdless chickens actions, werent a no brianer. because even tho he didnt have much if what we call"

"Idk how true this is, when I was in high school this kid did a very cruel prank on another student in science lab because the kid was sleeping. He put the kids hand on a burner plate that was super hot and the kid didn’t react at all for like 10 seconds and he horrible burns on his palm. It woke him up but it was after he woke up that he pulled his hand away."

Here’s a thought:
The brain and mind are two different entities that reside within one another, yet face several notable distinctions that by default make them separate. Commonly, people refer to the mind as more of a non-physical “place” in which feelings and opinions are taken into account and where we speak to ourselves within and such, while the brain is purely mechanical and functions for the sake of keeping our bodies up and running. 
We know that the brain controls our bodies (and, seemingly US, too), and therefore does what it pleases. But when we think of doing something bodily, we process it in our mind to make the decision; we have clear intentions of doing something, but at times these things don’t go as planned. Here’s and example I borrowed from a book: You awake one morning with the desire of, say, copulating with another.. so you do. But during the process, you realize you’ve become impotent. 
Did the body make the choice or did the mind? Did the brain intrude your sexual life just because it felt like doing so? And, are we really being controlled by a limp, buttery, jello-like organ?"

"Jesus loves you. God bless, share the gospel and put God first. i hope you have a nice week. Jesus isn't just someone who is divine, full of grace, and someone who can free you of all sin and death. He can also free you of depression, tears, sadness, and of a life that isn't great or fulfilling. I have found that in Christ, a happy, fulfilling, holy, and a better life. Many others have as well,  and I hope you do too. Jesus loves you so much that He died for you on the cross, taking your sin and death that once was hard to take back. Jesus forgives you of your sins and helps you to repent, and leads you into salvation which is given by the cross to accept the reward of Heaven, Jesus's Kingdom. We cannot earn it nor work for it, if you believe in the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, you will be saved. To be saved means to be saved from God himself, God's wrath lies on those who do not believe and rebel, joining the world in its evil deeds and practices. Jesus rose from the dead, showing the people that if He could conquer death, you can too. Heaven is where you conquer death. True salvation requires sacrifice, but in the end it is worth it. A life is never the same when Jesus impacts it. We are punishable by death by sin, but if you would say to the Lord, ""forgive me, help me to repent and sin no more and live a life for you"" we would do better, be better, and repent and be saved by Jesus Himself. Jesus is King, and ""I can do all things with Christ who strengthens me."" -Phil 4:13. God bless you. Jesus can win the battles you cannot win. God give us angles to protect us Jesus, please help up to love you and put you above all things in our lives. may your love Jesus protect us always, we need you :) God bless you if you read that, you didn’t have to but you chose to. God, bless us all please. Glory be to God the Father. Jesus’s works take us to heaven,  not ours."
