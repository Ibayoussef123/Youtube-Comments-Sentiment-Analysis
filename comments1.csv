I have a no brainer. Falling over
"To my knowledge, not a single cnidarian has a brain. Cnidaria's a phylum that contains sea jellies, sea anemones, hydras, coral, and more. Not a single animal from the phylum porifera has a brain, either. Porifera contains all sea sponges.

If you don't recall biology class, the taxonomy of life goes:
Kingdom
* Phylum *
Class
Order
Family
Genus
Species

Basically, phylums are huge. Even vertebrata, which consists of all animals with spines, is a subphylum, not all full-on phylum. In short, a gigantic amount of animals don't have a centralized nervous system. It's sad that Vsauce decided to present his extremely biased views instead of asking a sea sponge or a comb jelly what it's like. I've lost a lot of respect for him. It makes me wonder what other hidden biases he may harbor..."
Number 3: make tik tok videos
I can start a youtube channel and call it Vsauce

This feels so modern I forget its from 2012
"In the Hinduism they say, after you're dead , you lives in a form of ""pakage of tendencies"" a data form that don't have any command on actions and just floats according to it's inertia. Like a train without engine . Then it may stay in good ,ecstatic states told as ""heaven"" or disturbing ,uncomfortable states ""hell"" or you return as a life again and you don't decide it it's all your tendencies made in lifetime drives this form to the next stage. 
which makes me wonder like : a person who was desperate about heaven all his life, will be in desperation and wondering after death.
and maybe an aethist who tried to fulfil his life in this lifetime will reach a peaceful state after death coz there were no expectations. 

I arrived at the conclusion : living this moment properly will be good for this life. And for myself without ""My brain or Will""  in the timeless and unknown."
I think involuntry muscle dont require brain for their work so they will still do their work without the command of the brain

"It's not a ""no-brainer,""  it's a ""no frontal-lober."""
"Fun fact. Take care of adults with disabilities and ive taken care of someone who was born without a brain. She's 30 now. Still alive :) she is able to do so because of her brain stem. And its just fascinating seeing in person what it looks like to live without a brain. She reacts to all sorts of things. She can feel water temperatures, pain, she reacts to bright things like the sun even though she can't see. She sleeps and she is awake a lot of the time. She makes noises that reflect how she's doing, so say her tummy hurts she will whine a lot, she will smile at certain things like warm water or when she is around other people, ect. Now none of this means that she can see, feel, move, or have emotions, but there is a certain aspect about her that is hard to study because of how rare she is. She's pretty badass if you ask me."

"Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?
Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, ""Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.""

Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.

So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?

Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll pr- they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.

Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night."

Well let’s see here, based on executions which involved removing the head. The biggest thing you can do is die. You can also have seizures, muscle spasms. You can crawl. But of course this is just your body basically saying, what the fuck is happening my brain is gone. It’s not voluntary."

conclusion : shitting is a no brainer
What is a person? It's not just Flesh and blood. But a spirit which is our breath and our Soul which is our thoughts and Conscious. And we will all one day give an account for our thoughts and actions whether good or Bad when we leave these bodies and stand before the Lord. And we will certainly be found Guilty unless we are washed in the Blood of Jesus. For the preaching of the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation but to the Foolish Nonsense. I for one Know Jesus if you ask Him to forgive you He will. However we should also Love and forgive one another or else on that Day of judgement He will say I forgave you all your trespasses shouldn't you have had compassion even as I had compassion  on you when I forgave you? Then He will say take this wicked servant and cast him out. So Love and Forgive each other just as Jesus forgave you. That is walking is the Spirit of Love for God is Love. 1st John Ch 4 says God is Love and the way to Love is Being Kind Gentle meek patient Longsuffering forgiving merciful these are the ways to show Love not just to those who Love you but to those who hate you after all God is Also good to the wicked and we should do the same.

In 1945 farmer lloyd olsen went out to grab a chicken for supper. he cut the chicken's head off... and it didnt die. mile the headless chicken lived for another 18 months, he toured the ciuntry and surprise onlookers, he could wlsk and perch and was fed bu putting little drops of water or pieces of grain fown his theoat. but heres the thing, mike the hesdless chickens actions, werent a no brianer. because even tho he didnt have much if what we call"

"Idk how true this is, when I was in high school this kid did a very cruel prank on another student in science lab because the kid was sleeping. He put the kids hand on a burner plate that was super hot and the kid didn’t react at all for like 10 seconds and he horrible burns on his palm. It woke him up but it was after he woke up that he pulled his hand away."

Here’s a thought:
The brain and mind are two different entities that reside within one another, yet face several notable distinctions that by default make them separate. Commonly, people refer to the mind as more of a non-physical “place” in which feelings and opinions are taken into account and where we speak to ourselves within and such, while the brain is purely mechanical and functions for the sake of keeping our bodies up and running. 
We know that the brain controls our bodies (and, seemingly US, too), and therefore does what it pleases. But when we think of doing something bodily, we process it in our mind to make the decision; we have clear intentions of doing something, but at times these things don’t go as planned. Here’s and example I borrowed from a book: You awake one morning with the desire of, say, copulating with another.. so you do. But during the process, you realize you’ve become impotent. 
Did the body make the choice or did the mind? Did the brain intrude your sexual life just because it felt like doing so? And, are we really being controlled by a limp, buttery, jello-like organ?"

"Jesus loves you. God bless, share the gospel and put God first. i hope you have a nice week. Jesus isn't just someone who is divine, full of grace, and someone who can free you of all sin and death. He can also free you of depression, tears, sadness, and of a life that isn't great or fulfilling. I have found that in Christ, a happy, fulfilling, holy, and a better life. Many others have as well,  and I hope you do too. Jesus loves you so much that He died for you on the cross, taking your sin and death that once was hard to take back. Jesus forgives you of your sins and helps you to repent, and leads you into salvation which is given by the cross to accept the reward of Heaven, Jesus's Kingdom. We cannot earn it nor work for it, if you believe in the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, you will be saved. To be saved means to be saved from God himself, God's wrath lies on those who do not believe and rebel, joining the world in its evil deeds and practices. Jesus rose from the dead, showing the people that if He could conquer death, you can too. Heaven is where you conquer death. True salvation requires sacrifice, but in the end it is worth it. A life is never the same when Jesus impacts it. We are punishable by death by sin, but if you would say to the Lord, ""forgive me, help me to repent and sin no more and live a life for you"" we would do better, be better, and repent and be saved by Jesus Himself. Jesus is King, and ""I can do all things with Christ who strengthens me."" -Phil 4:13. God bless you. Jesus can win the battles you cannot win. God give us angles to protect us Jesus, please help up to love you and put you above all things in our lives. may your love Jesus protect us always, we need you :) God bless you if you read that, you didn’t have to but you chose to. God, bless us all please. Glory be to God the Father. Jesus’s works take us to heaven,  not ours."

What about no genes? How long would you live without them? 
 
On Star Trek, they ""transport"" people by breaking down their molecular structure to the atomic level, conducting the atomic particles to a new location, then reassembling them and converting them back to to molecules, arranged in the same order as when the process started. 

But, what if something when wrong with the restoration and reassembly process? 

What if the machine could reassemble all the biochemical molecules of the person, like the different enzymes and proteins and so forth....

But couldn't get the really fine detail of their D.N.A code correct, and just  their D.N.A, as a whole, was ruined? 

All the R.N.A and various enzymes that D.N.A produced before the transportation process would still be in there, but there would be *no more* new R.N.A (which is what D.N.A directly produces) sent out. 

Would the victim live for several moments, or a few hours, or a handful of minutes?  Or, would there be a second or two where they just quickly faded, and dropped dead? 

Any ideas?"

The most important question “Why does our brain come up with unanswerable questions”
Believing that 5G causes Corona virus is something you can do
"We have a body and we have a soul and spirit also inside of that body. So after death your soul lives on and goes to 1 of 2 places. Heaven if you believe in Jesus Christ and accept what he did for you at the cross wiping all your sins away because he payed the price for them in full. If you reject this beautiful free gift 💝 if as,cation you will go to be with him when you die.  On the other hand if you reject Jesus and what he did for you, you are then responsible for your own sins and will go to a place called he’ll. Noe I’m a born again Christian and I still make mistskes, and when I do I say sorry to Jesus and my sins are forgiven, they already are anyway but to respect him I appologise anyway cause I love 💖 him.

On a different note... it’s recorded that some people after having their heads cut off can still see for a few seconds after death!!! How scary would that be"

 What this vid is describing is the MIND. Brain is well a vessel. An organic organ which has a limited life. The mind however is the bio electrical signals passed and shared within the vessel, the ""brain"" to well just do about anything achievable and possible.
Two enitirely different MATTER if u wanna get nerdy.
Brain is a physical tangible matter.
Mind is the electrical signals that occur inside the walls of the brain.

"Why do people say “without the brain” or “your brain” you can’t separate the brain from yourself. The brain controls and send messages to body. So that means your brain and yourself is physical aspect of you, your body and skull is the physical temperament shell to protect your physical self and to move in the physical roam."
"For me what defines being you is basicaly your consciousness.
Everything else is just an Extension.
You are the consciousness the other Parts of you are just necessary for other things.
But i just said basicaly and thats not quite right.
Because consciousness is the mind.
Just that what makes you Think,be awake. Thats it. nothing More.
That means you wouldn't be able to feel. I mean the feelings you're Feeling if you didnt had These would it really still be you? Think about it.
You wouldn't even react to Pain,hot or cold,pleasure. Thats because you wouldn't be able to interpret these anymore. And whats with your memory? If you didnt have that either you wouldn't even be able to think,because there is nothing to Think about. So thats my final answer on an 7 year old video no one cares about anymore.
What defines being you is your consciousness, your feelings, and your memorys. There. Have a nice day for anyone reading this. Goodbye."

Did you know that if a brain is getting oxygenated blood (either from blood tubes or from a living being) it can continue living even if the body is gone. In fact that’s what scientists managed to do to the brain from a dog that got run over by a car and decapitated. The scientists managed to keep the dog head alive for 2 or 3 years before it died of old age. So in a way the scientists managed to keep a dogs head from dying. But if scientists can keep dog head alive then does that mean that the same goes for humans? Well no because the dog had a nerve problem that made so it couldn’t sense pain which is what ultimately made it survive so you can only survive getting decapitated if you either have the same nerve problem or if you have consumed a ridiculous amount of painkillers.
But what's the point of having brains when many people don't even use them?

Hey vssauce michael here in subscribing to vsauce is a no brainer or is it i mean you would need your brain to under stnad the words that I was speaking and you would need your brain to decide whether or not you liked what you were hearing you would also need your brain to move your muscles in just the right way to click the subscribe button, in fact, you need your brain to do a lot of stuff and without a brain well you cant do much of anything at all so literally speaking is there really such a thing as a no brainer lets begin with no headers decapitation its a macabre subject I know but whats the matter are you chicken okay good because mike certainly was In 1945 farmer lloyd olsen went out to grab a chicken for supper he cut the chickens head off and it didnt die mike the headless chicken lived for another 18 months he toured the country and suprised onlookers he could walk and perch and was fed by putting little drops of water or pieces of grain down his throat but heres the thing mike the headless chickens actions werent a no brainer because even though he didnt have much of what we would call a head left he did have a bit of his brain stem if we want a clearer no brainer we're going to have to look at an even more simple creature the cockroach these guys dont even breath through their heads so without them they're fine instead they breathe through holes all over their bodies. and instead of being controlled by a big massive brain they have little bundles of nerves ganglia throughout their body and soeven without any head parts even when completely decapitated a cockroach can live for weeks it can wak around respond to movement really its only problem is without its head it will eventually starve to deaath us humans are not nearly as fortunate without a head and brain we die within seconds if not instantly but before you get jealous keep in mind that with our heads intact we are capable of some actions that dont necessarily require the brain reflexes when you snap your finger your finger moves at about 20 miles per hour and a really big sneeze can expel air at 30 - 40 miles per hour but nerve impulses are really quick they can clock in at 250 miles per hour but sometimes thats not even fast enoughFor instance if you accidentally put your hand on a hot stove cells are dying quickly and 250 mph doesnt cut it you need to take an action fast its not worth it to tell your brain whats happenig right away and so instead your immediate reaction to pull away is mediated by other parts of your nervous system the same can be said for involuntary and unconcious processes for instance cardiac muscle is self exciting (unlike skeletal muscle which requires nervous system stimuli so in a way these unconcious involuntary or reflexive behaviors could be considered no-brainers but im not quite satisfied yet because they still require that your brain be there keeping you alive so what if you werent alive well in your dead brainless body your muscle cells still contain of energy in the form of ATP backyard brains right here on youtube deomstrates this with insect parts this leg is no longer connected to a brain or a body but energy remains in the cells and so researchers can detect electrical signals when the leg is touched or even simply breathed on the muscle cells of a human limb would respond in just the same way but you dont need wires to observe behavior like this salt can also do the trick the introduction of sodium ions can cause a process similar to an action potential in a living animal salt added to these fresh frog legs makes them dance though not for very long the cells will eventually run out of energy or simply decay but to be sure there are many other brief candidates for no brainers at the moment of death for example muscles relaxing causing a person to soil themselves technically a no brainer but its a misconception that a corpse contin ues to grow fingernails and hair instead its actually the skin itself sinking as it dries making hair and nails appear longer but lets tawke a closer look at these skin cells because we might be on to quite a satisfactory no brainer your skin cells live on the periphery of your body and they dont require a constant stream of new nutrients from your blood and even though your dead and your brain is no longer calling the shots your skin cells can continue to live gathering nutrients from osmosis and dividing for days infact you can harvest skin cells from a coorpse after 24 gours on a related note digestion sure a lot of the digestive processes completed by you being alive and having a nervous system that works but part of the work is done by bacteria that just haappens to live inside your gut and when your dead or when your brean is gone they will continue digesting so in a way making poop at least part of that process is a no brainer but heres the thing these bacteria that liveinside you are foreign bacteria are they you for that matter what about hte skin cells that can continue to live after your dead are they you or are they merely cells that you have made a good home for we're getting pretty philosophical here becuase were basically asking ifr you are merely your brain and everything else that goes on when you no longer have one is just other stuff that you arent doing You could argue that without a brain your body no longer has your intentions it no longer does things because you have decided to do them in other words a no brainer may be impossible for you to do because it requires not using you if you are merely what your brain does and not what your cells do off on their own when the brain is gone then in a way being you being alive is a yes brainerAnother great yes brainer is checking out vsauce 3 you can find some scientific video game analysis some gamer lut and some pretty cool apps to download go check that out and as always thanks for watching"

"Quick question: At 3:00 you say that 250km/h ""doesn't cut it"" and then refer to a diagram of a reaction arc travelling from stimulus site to ganglion root to effector muscle. Your statement implies that this path is somehow transmitting the impulse faster than the mentioned speed. Wouldn't that impulse actually have been carried at a similar speed? The time saved when bypassing the brain and using reaction arcs are not speed of impulse transmission, but rather the distance the impulse must travel which decreases the time taken. Right?"

They are usually detected early in pregnancy with ultrasonography."

"I am a paraplegic. You are right. I have spasms in my legs quite often. My legs even feel pain, alerting me when they sweat. 
There was someone that studied people destined for the guillotine. They were asked to keep blinking once the blade hit them. There were some people that could blink for up to 30 seconds or a minute. Whether this was just the normal spasms after death or actual spasms are up to interpretation. But he did say that the people looked straight at him as soon as the head fell. Of course this isnt considered brainless, but it's still quite interesting, even though it is macabre"

"The flat earthers have a brain.
They know the earth is a sphere.
They pretend it's not.
They pretend to be religious.
The purpose of this is to convince
no brainers that God is a joke.
They also mention anti vaxxers in the same breath as flat earthers. Another trick to keep you from investigating the truth about vacinnes. It's not about anti vaxx. It's about anti bad vacinnes.
Many young people fall for this deceit.
Young people have a brain, but many
of them don't have much inside of it.
Now, that's what I call a no brainer.
Older, wiser people like me are deceiving
the young. My generation have a ""head""
start. We haven't been bombarded with
loads of unnecessary vacinnes. And we have had many years of learning that you 
have not had yet.
We had a handful of vacinnes in our youth. Hardly any autism.
Once the MMR jab came in, a 100 fold
increase in cases of autism appeared in the stats.
That's the sad situation today.
Education standards have plummeted.
Now the young buy into all the mind numbing propoganda.
And there are loads of paid shills to see to it the young stay duped.
My advice to young people is this;
There are two sides to a coin.
You are presented with one side.
Look at the other side.
The side they don't want you to see.
And they've ""debunked"" it for you so you won't have the heart to take it seriously.
Look at both sides with critical thinking
and decide for yourself.  The more you learn, the easier it gets to see truth from falsehood.
Then you'll understand my generation are
duping yours. 
Not me, of course, I'm here to help.
And, good luck with your learning.
Learn and share."

"I like to think of it like this: Most of your actions are done by an autopilot, not by what you would consider ""You"". Autopilot is your friend. He's fast, energy efficient and can do surprisingly complex things (like playing a piano, tying shoelaces or even solve rubic's cubes ) so long as you've trained him to do them... But he has virtually no ways to deal with anything he hasn't been trained to do. That's where You come in: You handle everything autopilot doesn't recognize as something he's seen and dealt with before. Autopilot will watch You and learn by himself, but he picks up things faster if you teach him."

"Some might be unaware that the 'mind' most people refer to is the
intellectualized mind a small mini computer that remembers, plans
calculates, analysis, fantasies. And makes you believe that it is
YOU. That entity is the Ego a computer fueled & combined with 
primitive mammalian and reptilian emotions and feelings that now has
an intellectualized 'mind'. It for most of us is the a 'reasoning' monster.
Jaws with a map, a belief system and a need to be #1.

If you meditate you should familiarize yourself with Negation
Meditation. It takes awhile but you can see the actions of the Ego
when you stop thought. Sounds hard but isn't. Requires a little
work. When you stop thought and the mental chatter, you'll know
that without a thought you will still have awareness and not 
confuse yourself with your own Ego. You are more than your Ego.
Good luck! :)"

"I believe i learned this fact from watching you, remember the guy who had his brain split in half but still both sides functional inside his head.

Well both hemispheres were disagreeing with each other because they were acting on different information, so it could be argued that your brain is not one you.

So our body is made of billions of living creatures that can't live alone, therefore stick together so every cell can do one part of living other cells can't. That means that you can't say that when you're dead, the things your cells do is actually you doing that. But you also can't say that it is not you doing that because 'you' is actually the billions of cells stuck together. So it's up to you if you call living cells after dead a no brainer or a no you'er"

"To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand Shrek. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of swamp physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Shrek’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature,for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of these jokes, to realize that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Shrek truly are idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance the humor in Shrek’s godlike catchphrase “What are you doing in my swamp”, which itself is a reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Andrew Adamson’s genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools how I pity them

And yes by they way, I DO have a Shrek tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies eyes only- and even they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own(preferably lower) beforehand"

if the muscles stays alive when the head was chopped that means that the brain will stay alive for a certain amount of time and in our case we would still hear and see before the brain dies completely (scary idea) 😅
"we still need the brain to do the reflexes, if something happened to our body. The sensory system sends message to our brain and analyze whats going on causing to send back a command to where its from. If you cut a chickens head, its reflexes would still require brain. We have what we call muscle memory it sends message to the brain but without brain it would get stuck in the sensory system so which everything there is analyzed and sending back to the muscles causing relfexes. Actually i dont know what im talking about."

I've searched for the note sequence through various song search engines.
I've learned the sequence itself on piano.
I'm desperate, I just want the full song.

"I don't think ""you"" are only your brain. A lot of nerve cells don't exist in the brain, but in other parts of the body, and as you said with the Reflexes example, they can act on their own without your brain having to be involved.
EDIT: Besides that, there is another argument I can make: yes, when your head is chopped off, your body ceases to function... but so does your head. Your brain needs it's body just as much as your body needs the brain. And while you might be able to keep the head alive if you took over all of the functions of the body, so too can you keep the body alive if you took over all of the function of the brain. Just think of brain dead patients. Their brain no longer works, and yet they continue to ""live"" thanks to machinery."

"6:17 ""...bacteria that live inside you are foreign..."" No. Bacteria were here first. It is the bacteria that facilitated the rise of animals and they never left. Being human requires a microbiome in order for the organism to exist. That means humans are actually a superorganism comprised of one part human dna and thousands of parts (i.e., NOT foreign) microbial dna. You don't get to pick and choose which cells of this superorganism are the 'real' you. It may even be that the microbiome plays a role in consciousness. You know that craving you recently had? You think that was 'you' telling 'yourself' what to eat? If gut bacteria are deficient in certain nutrients, they send out chemical instructions which your brain acts on. The story you later construct about having a craving is just that...a story."

Watching this at 2 am and I think I'm not gonna sleep now.
But... Don't you need brains to get those reflexes? I mean.. Nerves system goes through whole body to the brains. So what you feel goes from nerves to brains. So wouldn't that mean that without brains you would be just... Meat?
OR IS IT ?
2012's Vsauce is thicc
"00:02 Wow, first time I got tricked into clicking subscribe. Did I use my brain solely because of the momentary thought that I need to prove that I can and that it might otherwise be useless?

"Killed a Spider by accident, a couple of its legs fell off and they still kept going."
"Minute 4:13, Living neurons on the leg?? WTF"
quick and simple answer: pretty much nothing
nothing.
"I keep reptiles, and my geckos need crickets, but if the cricket is too big I pull off it’s head and tong feed it to my gecko, so that it’s easier to digest. Anyways, this one time, I pulled off the head of a cricket, and set it down on a ledge in the tank so I could get my gecko to where I could tong feed, but the cricket walked. I watched it walk along the ledge as if it was alive, freaked out, I tried to pick it up with the tongs, but it jumped! It could tell I was trying to catch it. I picked it up again and put it in a little cup (used for putting powdered gecko diet in), and when I touched it again, it looked like it was having a seizure. I just handed it to my gargoyle gecko to deal with it for me.

Another time, I was giving my bearded dragon some super worms (beetle larvae), and she bit one, but it’s head fell out of her mouth, and their legs are practically sticking out of their necks, so only one pair of legs was remaining with a head on top. My dragon lunged for it, but it RAN AWAY. A head! Running away! I wish I had never seen it. It was the weirdest thing to witness. 

Anyways insects are creepy when you cut ‘em up. It’s even creepier when you see your pet eat the outcome."

Thing is, it swelled up and turned colors lol. But still, I was with my friend that cried over EVERYTHING. (I didn’t cry because my foot has some weird ass skin and it is thicc) but still if she even bumped her knee into the wall she’d cry and she didn’t care. I kept complaining because obviously I was in tremendous pain for like 2 hours (showing pain is like being a baby in my household) so I don’t know where I’m going with this but it was very ironic"
This reminded me of when my dog died 4:50
"Hello, Michael, Vsauce here :)

You may be interested in knowing that the latest quantum physics uncovered evidence that ""YOU"" are NOT in your brain but are a non-material entity somehow attached to the body (most likely through the brain). The evidence is that matter behaves differently when a human can observe the behavior versus there is no human observing the behavior. This type of behavioral change of matter was known for quite some time but in 2012 it was discovered that human beings are required for the ""collapse of the probability wave"" quantum effect to occur.

I get it! Ok it's enough at the start I think your new videos are much better I think this is around the time of having a few or more subs as in a few hundred thousand or more.
I've also subscribed
Michael I meant with the comment down below
look I'm just saying the content was good! but I keep getting confused wether if I'm angry in one part of the video and not angry I'm just a bit confused. for example you say what's the matter you chicken and it then makes me angry then you reveal a few seconds later. I think it's just the reflexes on how fast you reveal something or if my body is over sensitive with parts of the video. Is it ok if you can answer this question it might be answerable or not.

You need your brain to smash that mother fuckin like button
"I mean if you ask me, what ""you"" are is a lot of cells and other really tiny things coming together to make a big structure. If you take out the brain and your muscles react to things even though you didn't consciously tell them to it's still you reacting, but you're missing part of the process which makes it work properly. Like if you take a bunch of beams or other supports from a building, though it might still stand, and it is still the building, it won't stand very well because it's missing something important to stand properly."

"When you get get decapitated you actually stay alive as a human for a few minutes if not a few hours same as if you get shot in the head. You can live without a brain for surprisingly minutes if not then days, I know it sounds crazy! You feel things and you do also think things but you only think for your head and nothing else (this is a very rare occasion but very possible) that's why when decapitation happens you can make facial expression for a short time until you go brain dead. No it's not from trauma or from instinct it's you thinking it. Anyways decapitation is probably worse than death fire or drowning because you stay alive but you can't function at all, it will feel like sleep paralysis if you ever had that but you won't be able to function your brain for your body. It will be a living hell because you can also feel your body even when your head in off somewhere else, you feel both of it"

"Too bad he doesn't go to the bottom of the question. If your skin cells are not you, why you brain cells would be you ? They could also be considered to be separate organisms that help you to do what you do to live, whether it is digesting or thinking. Thinking is more interesting than digesting, but that doesn't mean that the cells responsible for the first should be more you than the ones responsible for the latter. If we think that, it is only because we identify more with our consciousness,  and that process of identifying with our consciousness, in essence, is just brain activity, it is philosophy but does not have any grasp on material reality. In reality there is nothing special in our brain cells that make them more us than our digestion bacteria. If you go down to the bottom of it, then, your identity, your impression of being one specific being, distinct from other things that are not you can just be considered to be an illusion. According to Buddhists, which studied the human mind for 2500 years through meditation, that illusion is formed by the combination of 5 specific thinking processes that are called the five skhandas and each of them are explained in detail."

u need a brain to live if u didn't u would *DIE*
but why some people have memory loss ?how to explain that?  easy the connection  stop working  only>connection  proof is many people have had been loss memory then in the future he remember everything ?how? the information in you're  brain  never ever deleted . only loss connection  .another proof  in judgement day  god make us again new body new brain  but he say no new soul .that means the memory in you're soul .for my opinion
"very funny >> the brain  is only detailed in the body between soul""MEMORY"" and body. if the head take off you lost the connection then brain lost the link then die >>"
"i told them but they didn't care or believe , the memory  not in  brain?? the brain only controlling the body  by  soul , the memory is your soul ,many people die and fly in the sky  and then back the live with EXTRA memory ??? that prove what he saw out of brain stack in soul    ...whatever"

"Fun Fact: A women in China was born without Cerebellum- a part of the brain that contains 50% of the brain's neurons. This means that she was born without half of her brain. But she lived quite well, without having much of a problem regarding the motor nerves and motor learning, or even balancing her body, the work done by the cerebellum. Amazed yet? You should be!! Cuz if u haven't you will get shocked *(to death)* if I tell you that a person of unknown origin (actually *I* don't remember his origin) was born with, *NO-BRAIN!* . Well, not literally, he was born without cerebellum, cerebrum, medulla, pituary gland, fore-brain, mid-brain, hind-brain. All that was left was the membrane-like structure that was kind-of stick to the skull, which literally did all the work that more than 1 billion neuron cells are needed to do. That ""membrane"" was merely having hundred thousand to a million neurons... You might be wondering that I made all of that up to catch your attention. But I haven't. This is a property of brain called brain plasticity, where the brain has the capability to compensate for the changes in the environment and the body- which  some people like these possess a lot. 


EDIT: I do not take responsibility of the content I just wrote. I saw it on the DNews channel of YouTube. You can watch the video yourself by searching in "" what happens if we don't have cerebellum"" or something like that. Find a DNews video regarding the same and you'll find out. It's amazing. A must-see suggestion from my side..."

"Saying that you are your brain is the same than saying that the operational system of your computer (For instance, Windows or Linux) is it's CPU.

You are a software."
"So is the skeleton inside of you, or are you inside the skeleton?"
"This video poorly distinguishes brain death from clinical death, and barely touches cerebral death from brainstem death. Each can be considered a different form of death as one or more vital functions is lost. Brainstem drives respiration, which could (though not necessarily should) be artificially replaced, example being locked in syndrome. Cerebral death can be in the form of chronic vegetative state, where like the chicken the brainstem keeps respiration autonomous, but person requires feeding. Clinical death is absence of breathing and organised cardiac activity which is potentially reversible in very specific circumstances and time limits."
"If cardiac muscles is self exciting. What about people who are brain dead in a comma? If the heart is beating, but you need your brain to ""live"" are people that are brain dead really dead?"

"Humans can move their arms and legs without a brain, via spinal cord reflexes.  Humans without brains can live for days, weeks, months, or even years as long as mechanical ventilation is provided.  Death of the body isn't an event, it's a process, various cells die at various times.  For example, bone cells can be viable 24 hours after circulation ceases."

"Isn't digestion a no brainer?   or a limited brainer.  You have your Enteric Nervous System.  ""the brain in the gut"". A separate ""brain"" or more precisely a network of nerves that has similar material to the"" brain in the head.""  Apparently leftover from the evolution of shellfish where it would have been the whole brain of the animal solely for the digestion of food, and other things take secondary place.  Gut feeling is what can be inspired by the Enteric Nervous System.  Apparently it has the intelligence of a cat;  it is linked to the main brain by the Vagus nerve which winds around and is nicknamed the Wanderer.  If that nerve is cut. the ENT can pretty much work on its own"

"Since no one on this page is making an intellegent comment, have you ever wondered why you can't swat a fly with your hand? Because the eye of the fly sees your hand start to move. It's already bending it's legs to jump up. By the time your hand is half the way to the fly, the fly is already flying because the eye connection to the brain in the fly is so short that he is seeing your hand in slow motion. Interesting is that we can out smart the fly every time. Knowing that a fly can't fly backwards and flying to the sides is difficult and slow, we only have to pick a spot about 4 inches in front of the fly to hit and you can swat the fly nearly every time ! Then wash your hand, ooh !"

Those frog legs almost made me puke 😷😷
MY ... FUCKING ... JOB!!!
Everything got real when the music came on
idont get it!!
that old YouTube though
"The title of this video makes no sense. You are your brain, so it wouldn't be you."

When he talked about reflexes: is that why when I get spooked I feel it in my chest: & is they why the Egyptians belied you thought with your heart?

What could you do without a brain? Win the 2016 presidential election
"To answer the title easily , you can play Yasuo"

Robots also have brains.
Nothing.
Sus
So what is the song on 6:23 ???

This video is endorsed by the International Council of Mindflayers.
"no, you are everything that is made based on your genetics. Your muscles, skins etc are based on those but the bacteria in your digestive systems are not. 

The philosophical question of removing brain is pretty stupid since you could achieve the same result by simply killing the person without damaging the brain."
"Hey! I live in the county (about 20 minutes from the town) that Mike the Headless chicken was decapitated. lol We have a huge festival in Fruita, Colorado each year its really fun. Its pretty popular with out-of-townies too."
"Salt can do the freaking trick?
 In that case, you couldn`t die in CS:GO, or Minecraft, or Call of Duty, or Garry`s Mod?, or Counter-Strike Nexon Zombies, or GTA V, or Battle Field, or Ruin Escape???????"
does Vsauce stand vagina sauce
Be a feminist
You could be a liberal
your brain thought of what it would do without it and it also named it self
"I am from the start for option that I am only my brain and my body is just device I use for keeping me alive and happy. You can remove one's arms and legs and he can live. Even head you remove body from (yes, you remove body from head, not the other way around) lives for few more seconds before dying by some researches. It is compeletly logical because my personality, my memories, my emotions etc. is what makes me me, and all of that is in my brain. Of course, this is philosophical and only my opinion."
I got a weird furry video recumended on this video -_-
Man you can tell the weight different from way back then lmao
I loved you
oh my god poor chicken wtf
haha I subscribed already!! and I rarely subscribe to a youtube channel
"What if a person is perfectly divided in half, leaving half a brain in one side and the other half in the other side... in the seconds before you die where are you, in the left or the right side?"

No brainers exist. They voted for Trump
you believe you will exist only till your desire does
So lets say you could put your brain in anothers persons body. Would you be yourself? or would you be someone else?
hi
Short Answer: No.
2:04 - 2:05 Look at michael and his mounth area
Ghost in the Shell in a nutshell
"Tell the exact final conclusion to all those people from the hospital in Rome who didn't unplug my grandfather while he was completely in a vegetative state with no way of coming back, arguing that he was ""still alive"". Do you guys believe that a person that can't feel or think should be forced to ""live"" just because of... ""moral""?"
"So if I put someone in a coma's hand on a hot stove, will their hand move away?"

*Nothing*. You would *already* be dead.
"Things you can do without your brain..... Nothing                Def.not anything; no single thing.
 it has a thing."
Vsause  is one of the few people that use their brains in the right way.
Make Vsauce vidoes.

How did the chicken know where it was going?
You lost me at michael

Probably reflex. I just commented on this video and now I'm quitting so bye.
"mike mike mike the chicken with no head mike mike mike mike 
the chicken with no head"
"If my digestive system is a tube that starts with an open cavity - my mouth, and ends with an open cavity - my anus. As it travels through the tube, is my food inside, or outside of my body?"
"Are you the real Jesus.      
jesus?"
Without a brain you could vote for Trump.
If you did not know sea cucumbers breathe through their butts
"You can vote for Hillary. But you can do that without a pulse, too."
First you say NO! Then you get out of there! If somebody touches you in a way or place that makes you feel uncomfortable  that's no good.
Michael has really lost some weight over the last 3 years
"The cockroach had lots of nerves walking around without a brain.....



Ehehe....

You can be a Kardashian.
Brain = hardware = chemical computer  = psychiatrist                     Mind = software = VR SIM in reality = psychologist
Once we slaughtered a calf and while skinning i struck a nerve on its leg with a knife and the leg hit me in the face
A. So that's why you should'nt speak to roaches.
michael always asks the important questions

"There are rare cases and forms of anencephaly where people live without a brain in their skull, and even live productively. Extremely rare, but true. There is an exceptional case study I read on such a man in England. Friggin nuts! So it would seem that this video is only partially correct. You can live and function without a brain, but you might not win on Jeopardy. :)"
I would start a war of wits but I seems that many of you are unarmed 🐗

"Things you can do without a brain:

Vote republican"
You can talk about politics and football for sure
No brain? You can come up with a theory explaining why the Earth is flat.
you do not need a brain to run for president as Hillery clinton
"Reactions still require the brain as nerves send the sensation of touch (in this case pain of touching something hot) to the brain, which allows us to feel pain. Basically if we didn't have a brain and touched the same hot thing we couldn't feel pain which means we wouldn't automatically pull our hands away as there would be no reason to!"
I bet the frog legs reaction was descovered in China right before someone wanted to eat them.
who is watching this in 2222
so that means I can shit in my grave or at a funeral in just the right moment?
"Wooo, just starting to understand the combined consciousness of all things.  (what we call sub conscious is the consciousness of all things).  So the question, what is me, the answer would be I am nothing and everything.  Because all consciousness is connected.  But I have free will. To do what I want regardless of what my subconscious wants.  So I am my consciousness.  hmh."

bacteria are not part of you but your all of you including your entire body. turns out your body also has your intentions sent down to them often works vise versa hunger or craving body telling your brain even sensations  it's major over looked part of tissue rejection. nerves also refusing to link. foreign organs tissue cells May even have their own taste habits even memories. in fact one way to help recall memories is to listen to your body your brain May not remember learning to walk but your. legs maybe
and your body doesn't instantly die usually can't express. no more signals. some times body body is still what is what Hell muscles jumping every were
insects aren't simpler just different design.

"if i remember correctly nervecells transmit signals by using 2 mecanisms.  Inside the cell the use a fast ""electrical"" signal. When the signal jumps between cells the transmissoin  is chemical.. The electrical is pretty fast, but the chemical is quite slow. (and i beleive there where 2 types of nevers, smooth never (slow) and ""ringed nerves"" that had hardend rings around the long part of the cell. These rings help the transmissoin speed, cuz the voltage jumps along the body ring by ring."
"wait, you just said that in passing! so if you lose your head your heart could keep beating?!"
i feel like you dont have a soul. you ARE a soul and have a body :) so when your brain is gone and so is your consciousness you have no more impact on the actions of your human shell. your body is not you and the bacteries neither so there are no brainers but there have nothing to do with yourself :p just my opinion on this :)

"It is pretty scary tho, like, look on the mirror, exctly everything you do is by muscles, nerves and stuff. Why they're doing it is cuz they're responding to signals coming from your brain. Even your senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting) are just reponds coming to your brain. When you hurt yourself, you will get signals from your nerves that there's somthing that interupts there. And if it still hurts, it means your nerves are still damaged which keeps sending signals..."

If it was any other organ that had been injured, it could hypothetically be replaced and he would still be him."

"This is what people pass off as intellectualism. How is this even a practical question? What the fuck does this even accomplish? You get shot in the head, chances are, you're going to die. Why? Because you need your brain. Maybe if you used this opportunity to explain the different complexes in the brain and what their functions are, but you don't. You prattle like a child while trying to appeal to idiots who have no concept of critical thought, much less science."
"hey, I wonder why you didn't mention the kid that was born without a brain and lived for two years before dying. He was apparently born with only the brainstem. He couldn't see, hear, smell, taste or do much of anything. I was having a conversation about this with a friend and he said that ""this child, though a human is not a person."" his reason was, because the boy doesn't have a  brain, he cannot think or act, he is basically an empty shell who has no  personality, and since personality is the characteristics of a peson, this boy is not a person. In another words since he has no personality he is not a person.
But what do you think?"
Holy Cow he's lost weight...!

"1. Did Mike the Chicken get the part of his brain capable of pain cut off? Because if not, kind of f-ed up that they let him walk around for another 18 months.

2. The bacteria in your gut isn't you like your skin is because it doesn't have your DNA. Yes, philosophically, we are just a sum of parts, but unless your clothes are also literally you, we have to draw the line for where one system/object ends and another begins somewhere, and DNA is a good boundary because unless I don't understand how DNA works (which is a very real possibility) it also moderately resolves the Theseus paradox by at least staying consistently the same string of information from birth to death."

Uh...you used to be fat.
"I once had a dream that I had a surgical procedure, where my brain was removed. They took out my brain and put it on the table, whereby the view changed to the brain, as it was rapidly consumed by flesh eating (or at least brain eating) moths, to the background music of the theme song to Beverly Hills Cop. Then after I had my brain removed, and everyone was convinced I was dead, I surprised them, and as I stood before them, I spoke in a deep, echoey voice, and when I walked, my footsteps sounded like I weighed several tons. And I said something terribly profound and mysterious in my deep echoey voice. I assume it was terribly profound. I don't actually remember what it was I said. Thus it is at least mysterious, since I don't know what I said. Then I woke up. Based on this, it is clear that all that will happen if I get my brain removed is that I'll get much more awesome than I am now. Which is rather awesome already."
"you are not your body nor your brain , just like your organs are tools you use to do other stuff , heart to circulate blood and stomach to digest and hands to grad shit with , a brain is just another organ that you use to think , who am i is one of the biggest scientific and philosophical questions that have ever been asked , and you can only make approaches to answer that questions , you can be defined in spiritual terms as your soul , you are a soul , and your body is just a tool that your soul can use in the physical and materialistic world , you brain can be defined as a tool of thoughts , what are thoughts ? are they just a electrical impulses ? the reaction between two neuron cells in your brain ? that makes no sense , thoughts cannot come from the physical world 
example : a tv does not projects channels , a tv is just a tool that you use to catch signals that are being transmitted from other places like a satellite 
a person who studied philosophy would understand how human make connections and pointing fingers at what is the cause of this and they can be wrong all the time , just like when a not so informed person about modern technology would think that the tv is giving you those channels , same goes when talking about a brain , you would think that the brain is giving you your thoughts thus being defined as your self , but infact that statement makes no sense , what would be more logical and makes more sense is to say that your brain is just giving you your thoughts that its getting from another place , like your soul for example , this soul or what ever you chose to call cant exist in the physical world but in another realm that is not bounded by space and time
again those are just approaches and thoughts to try and deliver an answer of ""who am i ?""

QUE: what is actually happaning inside our brain when we thinking .like, when you have to think to make decision you have different types of idea's thats like our different part of brain giving the different idea there's always a more logically correct and other is like lazy one (you know what i mean )

i am not very expressive about my thought there is a lot in mind and i would like to listion about this topic so give it a thought"

"Sorry for bad grammar, but read this. There are excellent spells.
If i don't have a brain, i would be zombie or very stupid.
Remember, zombies don't have brain, and they're stupid for not knowing everything what does human know. Is that why they don't have brain? With a brain, it would be smart than zombies, be normal as a human.

+ Animals ability.
+ Causing things stupid like knocking door or things with hands. 
+ Groaning as zombie, human don't groan like zombie.
+ Zombie is cannibal, Human is not cannibal.
+ Trying to eat a things who move or make sounds too loudly. Is human like that? No
+ Zombies can't remember because their memory is deleted, no brain inside head.

What if zombie exist?
Don't blame god. If so, think again why it's god fault? Of what?
Jesus wants bad thing and evil things go to hell. God is not evil. God is good. God made Earth, planet you live on. 

If zombie don't exist, then, What if you don't have brain? This will be bad idea. If you wan't know why, This would be happen :

+ In a pain.
+ A lot accident thing will happen.
+ Doctor can't explain if they don't have book about no-brainers. It's their fault if they hate to read books or not buying book brain.
+ When your brain got destroyed, your all memories will be 'removed Permanently'.
+ Without brain, your brain won't grow up again. If limbs got destroyed, they're not growing back. It's permanently deleted.

With a brain, that'll would do very good things which is smarter than zombies or no-brainers. And i feel sorry for peoples who don't have brain.

If you're ''half''brained, you can live longer you want, it's okay idea. Things will happen.

+ Okay talking
+ Smart things than no-brainers
+ Accident will happen in someday like 1 or more. (i hope you don't have bad accident xD )
+ Okay body of yours
+ Believe in a lie or trick too much but your friend as brainer will help you.
+ Get a good friends

How to be smarter as a half-brained :

+ Bad things won't happen for half-brained, but better be careful, and try not to act stupid, it would help you not to be stupid but slowly becoming smart if you teach too much things in a book.
+ If you don't know how to read, ask your friend to teach you how to read and understand at all what peoples said.
+ What if you don't have computer, tablet, iphone or books? Your friend will teach you.
+ Don't let peoples teach you stupid things or you're not smarter a lot.
+ Bullying peoples won't help you become smarter.
+ If you didn't buy a book, ask people as your friend to buy. 
+ Be a kind man/woman. Something will happened not good if you're not kind.
+ Learn things in your computer or tablet if your friend can't buy books.  To learn, just go to a wiki. Wiki helps you become smarter.
+ Drink healthy drink, and eat good / safe foods. You will learn why you like healthy and good, safe things. How does a healthy good drink and food taste? Safe, no poisonous, no venomous, good, healthy.
+ Don't believe in a people's lie, it makes you look like stupid. People can trick or lie to you.

Trick = Peoples who you don't know, talking to you, IGNORE THEM. It's a trap. Don't eat foods or drinks from peoples, it may be deadly. You can talk to your friend only. Friend is good and more important as your family. When a stranger came to you and helping you, which means they're ''innocent'' peoples. If they're not, then why they would stranger have to help you as a evil or devil? Be careful, think of yourself. A people who trick, says like that "" Here you go "" if you didn't say thanks.
The innocent says "" No problem "" when  you said Thanks.

Don't blame God. God wants humans to be HEALTHY. It's not his fault. If it's his, then why God has to make Earth? Does look like God don't care? He really cares. He made a humans exist, animals exist, all real things exist and that's how we call Planet Earth. If monster exist, that means it's a scentist who made it life or different animal birth happen to give birth a such monster life. Different animal birth, means a wolf and dog makes werewolf. How about animals? Not God, it's animal fault for doing different birth or scentist made monster life in lab.  Wow, stupid human who blame god. And feel free to agree me or comment me, but hater, go ahead and command me as such stupid mean things. I don't care, i enjoy to annoying you as *hell* :3 you will see, hater. expect peoples who agree. baibaibaibai

Brain is the most important organ... according to brain :D
Screw Vsauce3 and 2! Michael is the only one I'm listening to! *nohomo*
"no, i dont think its possible to do anything or stay alive without brains, brains is the ""person"" ""personality"" ""a living being"" ""consciousness"" anything else its just a body parts controlled by you and impulses, we are the brains. and about that headless chicken who lived about 18 months without head, in my opinion the body somehow itself got neurological impulses from the brain and there was still a lot of oxygen left in that body, so it kept the chicken body alive by those impulses but it of course was unconsciousness, so it looked like alive but it was COMPLETELY dead."
I get head all the time and I'm just fine..

just a little note here: in the future we might be able to transplant our heads or even brains onto a cloned body when technology allows it so your body might not be you even your head might not be you. Our self awareness is all in the brain your arm isnt you.
Do something on why don't we go to sleep when we know we should!

"The epidermis of the skin, the outer layer of the skin that is exposed to the outside (basically what most people would consider the skin), are composed of cells that are already dead to begin with.

The outside world is a harsh place so if our epidermis was actually alive, they wouldn't last every long. Epidermis cells basically kill themselves by stuffing themselves with keratin so they can protect the rest of the body, the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good of you will.

It is ironic that we find humans touching to be so imitate and beautiful when it is essentially a touch of death."

"one time my mom was still a child she was in her grandparents house with my 2 uncles and my grandparents. they went outside with the housemaid to get a chicken for lunch, the maid cut the chicken's head of and it started running around headless chasing my uncle. he got so scared that he doesn't eat chicken until today and he is already 50"
ow my brain hurts :/
Wouldn't you still have electric impulses for reflexes from the brain

What about that kid that lived for a year and was born without a brain?
Jellyfish have been living like this for millions of years. They seem to be fine.
"I literally have to pry myself off of youtube to stop watching Vsauce. This guy really works my brain, literally to the point of having a head-ache, and i'm a fairly smart, scientifically/mechanically minded person (definitely not bragging, plenty of people smarter than me). I'm always fascinated with what ever video he's made. It could be something like, ""How does gasoline burn"" or something and he always has an interesting, mind-blowing perspective. "
"If later on someone makes a successful brain transplant between two living people.

So when youre considered brain dead how is your organs still working or hasn't failed yet 
Of course people can do stuff without their brains! How do you think Congress works?
"The part about the gut/intestines is not accurate. The digestive system is controlled by the enteric nervous system, which is more or less controlling itself, but receives input from the higher centers. 

All the patterns and actions generated by the digestive tract originate from the enteric nervous system.

Also the heart part is also not exactly true either. The heart rate is controlled by the vagus nerve and the sympathetic nervous system, on the other hand, the heart does beat at 100bpm if all nerves to it are cut, but then you also have hormones acting on the heart as well..."
"very good video but instead of not having a brain, you can have part of your brain , at least most of it, taken off and you would still be alive"
"My roach lived for 2 weeks with no head. He got skinny....

Why am I on this thing????"
"That philosophy at the end made me close my laptop, close my eyes, and rethink life."
I was eatting noodles when I started watching this..Not anymore. 
"I had a cousin who was born with only a brainstem instead of a full brain. She only lived a year, had as you can imagine, had to be fed with a tube."
i dont get it if your heads of your head still has a brain so your head should move
That explains why I can't snap my fingers and doesn't explaim why I don't have physical reflexes unless I feel pain. But I can react to something decently fast in a game. Just not in Counter Strike or TF2 online. Great video as usual you from the past. Literally. This brings me to a suggestion (Why I'm commenting) is Time Travel POSSIBLE to happen in the future WITHOUT Wormholes and going into Space and waiting a few minutes. I'm talking Doctor Who Type shit here.

"I thought u could ejaculate without a brain, cause the order to do that mostly comes from the nerv systems in your spine ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"Actually, if a human is decapitated cleanly, the head will continue to move and blink, move its eyes and make small facial expressions that may last up to a maximum of about 30 seconds. The head will function properly and I guess you will see the world through your ""decapitated"" head, and possible your own body. I guess blood loss will eventually make you dead."
Our congressmen all do quite well without them.

Now this is my 1 friend is crazy he said he has no brain
"Pause at 2:05 to witness ""The Knowledge Shower""!"
Incredible ._. I often wonder whether I am defined by my brain or whether I'm defined by everything attatched to me. I end up coming to the conclusion that my brain provides my personality and my personality is who I am.
I love the intro. Vsauce is the king of self-esteem.
I'm surprised by the lack of jellyfish in this video
For some reason whenever I come here with a question I usually leave with 50... Lol.

"Okay, so I was wondering, If that chicken can live without a head. When is something actually dead? Like a snake can still bite, idk how long after his head is chopped of, can you check that out? :D"
"A kid was born with only a brainstem, he lived for 2 yrs"
"Are we merely our brains? I've wondered the same thing.

It's a question that inserts unease into the idea of live organ harvesting. The thought of removing the still-functioning heart of a person does creep me out, but that doesn't mean the donor is actually alive anymore."
thats like you take a frog leg and put salt on it they are moving
that chicken looks creepy
I no many people who are doing pretty good without having a brain 
you have *earned* a subscribed :)
no.... my friend he was :( okay so my friend walked on the road and the light was red for the cars and one car hit his brain and i walked to school and i was like OMG and my friend was walking can u believe it hes some kind off monster Dx
you know what else you can do without a brain? Be a politician.
"I plan to live forever, and the new technology of the next decade will allow me to do so"
Why did the chicken cross the road? Because he had some brain stem left.
So If cockroaches evolve their mouths to be on the bottom of their abdomen they would be able to live without a head?
"What if you didnt have a body? Would it theoretically be possible for your brain to survive without your body? And apart from the shock of not having a body, how would one cope with being just a brain?"

This is why that chicken needed obama care
you can run for congress 
I heard somewhere that the average sneeze travels at 95mph?!
Never .... eating .... frog legs.
You could be a politician...the lack of a brain doesn't seem to stop most of them lol.
As soon as i saw that cockroach i started shuffiling around in my bed lol
"  Without a brain, you can always be a politician !"

Did you know that when you kill a fly without severely damaging its body you can make it come alive by putting salt on it!
well i can post stupid comments without a brain...which is what i'm apparently doin.
Does anyone know what the name of the song is at 5:49?! It's been killing me that I don't have it! :(
"Actually you can survive with a brain stem, and not a brain... However, you're not self aware... Anencephaly look it up."
"There are these lizards in South East Asia called ""Tiktiki"" and when you surprise or try to harm them the lizards cut off their own tail and the tail continues spazzing out for like a minute but eventually stops. How does this happen?"
What I really wonder is it really possible to make a body for a dead man's brain. I mean I see sci-fi movies with villains that have a robotic body with a brain controlling It. Is that possible.
"Happy Easter! Since Jesus returned to life, does that technically make him a zombie?"

awesome. Just awesome.
"If we assume that the brain is the seat of the consciousness (because we have no definitive proof one way or another), then it might be safe to say that the brain is the truest part of us which counts as making us human, and the sack of blood, bones, and organs is nothing more than an advanced vessel by which we explore our surroundings with. Which begs the question; if brain transplantation and full recovery were possible, could we change bodies but keep our personalities?"

"After watching this I remembered a story told to me long ago during a history lesson. A Japanese commander and the soldiers under his command were captured by the enemy after a great battle(Chinese-Japanese conflict).                                                    Facing execution(beheading), the commander made a deal with the captors. The Japanese commander told them to behead him first, and he would run past his comrades in line next to him carrying his own severed head. The number of his own soldiers he passed while running would be spared. Laughing, the Chinese soldiers agreed, thinking this would be an unachievable feat.                                                         To their surprise and astonishment, the japanese commander completed the run of roughly 20 feet(6 meters), the story goes, and he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers. The Japanese soldiers were given their freedom as promised and safe passage and the story was passed on. Even though this story might be ludicrous I can´t help but think of those ""few seconds"" Vsause talks about in this video. Reflexes or the ""last command"" from his brain to his body, would be amazing if it were proven to be at least scientifically plausible. :)"

Or, I mean, it made my brain think too much.

Unless I am my brain...

You lost a lot of weight since tis vid
"when you talk about snapping your finger, do you mean sensory or motor impuses?"
Millions of people seem to manage without it. So what's the problem?
What can you do without a brain? Hand Thing.
But many people on this Earth question the idea if all Humans actually have a brain.
Great video as ever!
"For some reason, I find this nerd to be sexy"
vote here to make Michael chubby again :)
hurr hurr Tubby Michael 
"Gosh, he's lost weight since this video."
If I didn't have a brain I would at least now have a compartment in my head the shape and size of a brain I could store stuff in.  Like a trunk.
wait. im not sure i heard u right. mike the chicken was fed by dropping little drops of water and brain!?!?!?
what about the boy who lives without a brain? Google him if you haven't heard about it.
iI NEVER ASKED FOR AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS 
"About that comment of what is ""you"" what I think is that your brain decided to make your arms, legs, heart, etc. is ""you"""
Was no one else creeped the hell out by the moved frog legs?
Spitting words around 2:03
Your philosophy is so mind boggling 
froglegs...disgusting.
"What Can You Do Without a Brain?
hmm.. that was recommended for me -_- aahhh"
"""Make poop""
So does that mean that dead people can still take a dump or fart?"
"I am myself. My muscles, my skin, my organs, my BRAIN. My existance requires me to have the BRAIN and the REST of my BODY to feel living. Life is a game and my body is my game piece (the brain is a part of it too). My interpretation of life is feeling that i am alive so no-brainers don't exist in my rule book."
You can be a politician or a solicitor without a brain ;-)
A lot of people without brains do an awful lot of talking.
You are the reason I have good grades.
"i can not move without a brain longer than you,thats what i can do with no brain"
Michail how do get this smart?
"A bit simple, but nonetheless very interesting. Subscription initiated!"
I shouldn't have eaten breakfast while watching this.
That's some conspirisy shit
I once put my fingers on the plates that you cook on and i had them there for 3 sec and dident feel it but my hand went off and i were upp all night holding my hand in ice water...
your so scary
"we all are brainers,this is what's characterizes us from other things, species...why then!!! why us specially!!!"
You can exist.
How can you brain when only 500 people in world?
"
I don't care I saw the roach and I left XD"
"I REALLY wanna know how babies are born without brains and live. Unless some of their brain or their brainstem and a small brain develops, thus being technically, maybe brain dea--
No, that doesn't even make sense.
Is a baby born without a brain some sort of term and condition?
Or is that stuff really possible?"
"There is a boy who was born with no brain and he is, I believe, five or six"
"What about muscle spasms

"What do u think about our soul ? because i think our body is just a body ! However, all the action that we do is coming from our soul ! We all have almost the same body. however, we do different things. We like different things. I think my soul is me. !"
You can vote Republican without a brain.
"You are your brain? To narrow down this idea we can say that we are our brain's choices, reactions to stimuli in our environment, because this is what makes us differentiable from others hence, making you, you. Our imagination is another aspect of the brain that differentiates and defines us from others.
You = your brain = your reactions to stimuli in environment + your imagination. That's a 'yes brainer'."
"""cells are... dyeing""

Did michael gain weight? I don't mean any offense by it just curious. because I haven't watched a Vsauce video in a while
Weird I click his video on my subscriptions yet when I click on this video shows as an unsubscribed person -_-
fvck that jump scare 1:36
is you wearing a V neck shirt on purpose?
"I do. This guy that posts science videos, are FAILS. This guy doesn't know anything! Wow. Plus, Vs, you should stop posting things like this. Something that can't happen? This is supposed to be science. Not history. Second, if you don't have a brain, you would be mental. You could explain you're self dead. You wouldn't know how to breath, move, blink, or things like that."
DONT TELL ME WHAT I NEED MY BRAIN FOR
"This video, mind blow. "
"I can do anything without a brain, I dont have one XD"
he was a little fat back then haha

If human bodies use electricity to move or for the heartbeat.Can humans evolve in a point of time create electricity??
mind fucckedd
What about heads decapitated from a guillotine? Lots of old studies claim heads continued to live after be severed. If parts of the body can still function without a head then can the head function without the body? For how long? Is there any modern tests on this topic?
FROG LEGS + SALT = *FREAKY!!!!*
Mike the headless chicken so cool
"When he asks if we are merely our brain, I get depressing. I say we are merely atoms and that everything we do, will do, or have ever done is just physics. Enjoy the rest of your life lol."
MIKE
"The roe deer's stomach muscels is going to go on working it's content even after it has been removed, shortly after death."
"Thumbs up if you started moving your mouse when he said ""You would need your brain to move your muscles in just the right way to hit the subscribe button."""
Is it just me or does he look fat here?
"I have a small question .... When we touch a hot cup we have a reflex and quickly remove our hands ,,, but why when we do this intendly we experince no such thing till we are actually getting burnt "
We are a big mass of cells so if no brain too control them the cells will manage themselves for a period of time. Yet our cells are not born to live separately from the brain and the cells will die in short time! :)
So zombies are impossible?
you can still have an orgasim after death.
I like that song
"What if you somehow quickly gave a decapitated head a supply of the things needed to live? Would it survive or would having no organs, body, ect. cause it to die anyway. (Basically, could they do the thing from futurama)"
"To answer the title of this video, just look at liberals in the US"
I shouldn't have watched it while eating...
Isn't there a legend of some guy being beheaded and then the head briefly made an expression at someone as if it was still alive? I think I remember hearing it in a history class. Pretty scary though..
Mike the headless chicken for real wow lol this is crazy
"I know how anything can do something without a brain, get pulled down towards Earth by gravity. A dead person can have their brain with no activity whatsoever but can still be pulled by gravity. :-)"
i cant eat while watching this 
oh my god... that frog leg thing was disturbing...
I ne3d tp peeeee
hasn't there been recent studies about heart being like the brain
EVEN FRICKEN DANCING FROG LEGS AM I GOING INSANE?!?!?!?!?
Head less chicken WHAT HAS THE WORLD COME TO?!?!?!?
Nothing
It's very interesting.
"yikes!
yikes!
yikes!
yikes!
yikes!
yikes!"
so people make poop when dead... no wonder people say they stink...lol
At 2:05 you see a cockroach flying out! Or was it a grasshopper? 
"Why cant we stop thinking? And since we cant not think why do we sometimes run out of ideas, things to say, or do."
Why does Michael look fat in this vid. In more recent vids he isnt fat
"Hey, I'm wondering... how do we think? What is that inner voice in our heads when we think? Someone please answer, or link me to a usefull video, thank you."
So now whats the function of the soul (If it even exists) since Im not me without a brain?
"If skin cells aren't really you, then neurons that make up your brain aren't really you either. Maybe you is simply the emergent state of consciousness produced by a bunch of cells that just happen to be connected and work together. "
I'm a portable brain. I have a body to conveniently port myself around town and to any other locale my intent desires.  
dafuq?
"fun fact, when you're dreaming you can still hear everything but your BRAIN decides if it's important enough to wake up"
a ant can live without it thorax
WAS THAT THE CRAZiEST EVER OR WHAT¿¡
"The thing he squeezes the ""v-sauce"" out of at the end of every video - is that a floppy disk or an NES cartrage?"
"Funny, I thought politicians nowadays don't have them!"
I think that we are our  body because if we change brains with someone else they would still control thenselfes but they would get your memories
Dat chicken thing. 
Annyone heard of some guy named Pewdiepie? Thunbs up! (with an n)
Yesssssssss Brainer!
Didn't talk about jellyfish. I'm disappointed in him. 
I hate you (1149 haters)
"Well, according to people I see veryday, i'm pretty sure people can leave without an active brain."
So in the end... Who's me?
Anyone remember the scene in Madoka Magica when Kyubey (SPOILER ALERT) tells the girls that the soul gem is really THEM and it needs to be near them in order to live? This reminded me a lot of that.

"At once I've just really gone, like blown away, then vsauce said ""are your brain you?"""
"1,145 people dont have a brain"
Anencephaly is a no brainer
"At the start of the vid and I saw the title I was like.. ""What can you do without the brain"" YOU CAN DIIIEEEE"
Do bacteria have brains?
"your mind really is ""you"" if you think about it. thats why when people die they dont refer to the person but to their body. or even if you have an out of body experience you dont say i saw myself but i saw my body. if i transfered my conscience to another body i would still be me because of my mind."
"What can you do without a brain? Idk make Vsauce videos? OHHHHHHHG SNAP!!, "
"i hate that he says tell your brain. 
You are your brain!"
Keep up the vids man! You helped me dump on my Neuroanatomy final much love brother <3!
so thats how the zombies live without a brain?!
"Technically only some of your brain is you. The primal brain which performs simple tasks like move, sleep, drink and eat is not you. All of your personality is gone and replaced by instinct, but ""you"" could still live this way."
Omg Mike looks funny X3
I saw a video on youtube about a baby born without a brain who survived.  I was hoping you'd mention that.
You can also become a Senator
****hannible
Ergg... just got a honnible lecture brain flashback... ergg.... :(
"WOW he lost alot of weight mayyn, Well Done Fatty!! "
Without brain...we can die!
theres 1 one thing i know u can do without a brain... being dead.
You could run for president of the USA. There is a guy in office right now doing it and it has not stopped Nancy Pelosi or any of the rest of his cronies either!
well this explains why the fish my mom brought home from the market were still flopping around a little even though they were beheaded.
"The Human Body, like any multi-cellular organism is what is referred to as a ""Super organism"", an organism that is made up of other smaller organisms. A cell in the body is a complete cell, but is so developed to perform a specific task whether part of an organ, like the Livery or Brain, or functions between organs, like blood cells.

Unlike a cockroach, as an example, the human body is highly centralized and requires a complete nervous circuit to function. A cockroach can get along without its head because its ""brain"" is spread throughout its body. So it's ""brain"" can function its body at least until it dies of starvation. The circuit is NOT broken. Obviously a Human body can not function when that circuit is broken.

That said, there are parts of the super organism that can function separate of the rest of the super organism that is being functioned by the brain. Bacteria processing bodily waste, outer skin cells adapted to survive on the outside of the super organism, and so on. These do not need a brain but do need the rest of the body to to function at some level to continue to function themselves.

Technically there is such a thing as ""no brainer"" however that only applies to any function that does not require actual thought or coordinated nervous response. Anything you have any level of direct control over, even reflexes, which are basically automated mental responses, is NOT a ""no brainer""."
cool
So when Deadpool gets his head cutoff or disconnected.. He wouldn't be able to move his body.. LIES!!

"1,135 people do things without their brains"
lol he s a little fatter than now
what about making modern pop music?
"thankyou very very much, I stared to think the only people with success in youtube was people who has video saying just crap, and It feels very good to see that I was wrong and there is people like you saying very very interesting stuff who have millions views also. Congratulation and thank you again."
...But what if subscribing to vsauce IS a reflex?
Lol

"Wow.. you just came with the philosophical question I asked myself many years ago (I guess I was around 10-12 years old at that point), and I would say my theory is that we are just the brain. the rest of the body is just something we need to function."
livin' n shit...
"dude I'm just begging you, put more of these stuff in here. I love them."
Yea
"Well, i don't believe I have an immortal soul, and If you put my brain in a robot body, I'd still be me. I am my consciousness."
"It's a shame I don't remember a name of the guy, but supposedly a WW1 soldier who got killed, was found to be without a brain when performing an autopsy. I read this somewhere a long time ago. Seems that somehow his spinal cord took over brain functions and allowed him to be a normal person, yet... without a brain.
Maybe cool to see if you can find some info on it. Don't quote me on it though, it must have been at least 25 years ago when I read this."
"well well well...do you know störtebecker?, the old german pirate?, he run headless some metres!
and there´s a child celebrating its 2nd birthday without a brain...if this second story isnt a fake..."
I wish I had a Vsause brain.
interesting!  
I wish teachers at school we're like Vsauce... We'd all actually learn more! 
You just fucked my mind lol
Mike was so lucky he didn't die when he got decapitated. I'm not really a fan of killing animals for food.
"At the first second of the video, he should have just said ""Nothing"". And the rest of the 7 minutes is blank."
"idk if i mentioned this before but in the end if the brain is all thats ""you"" that also means that brain transplatations will NEVER be able to exist...

body transplantations would be what it should be called instead."
how about without a heart?
"Vote and breed, apparently."
Yea I felt like questioning my life and everything.
i love this guy.....he makes me feel so dumb yet so smart at the same time
Those frog legs needed little top hats and canes. After that they need some butter to go with the salt and some light frying. Yum!
"I used to know 2 girls without a brain, but they had a brain stem.
 They couldn't talk, see, hear, eat, walk, or do anything without assistance. But they could love. The 2 sisters were happiest when the other was there and they knew when one wasn't. This suggests that emotions happen either in the brain stem or they are innate and cannot be taken away."
"Hey Vsauce, I have a question.
Can a cockroach really survive a nuclear blast?
Can it survive a direct hit from a point blank nuke?
What about shoes?
How did the cockroaches survive the dinosaur extinction?"
"Please do ""What happens if you don't sleep?"""

Theres a 2 year old kid without a brain.
Omg the dancing frog legs are really really scary :oo
what does it look like when our eyes turn blind?
"I had never seen the frog legs thing before. It caused me to heavily refer back to ""Why Are Things Creepy"", because AUGH!!! AAAAHG!! GAH!!! SONOFA--! EW!"
How long can your brain live without your body?
"Well...
Pretty cool... And what really got to my brain is that you have a very good communicative expression.
Other than that... yeah... I believe I am my brain... always did...
And don´t bother tryin' to stick ""souls"" and ""spirits"" in my body... My brain doesn't give a shit for those thoughts... and as an autonomous entity... ""he"" (my brain... or let's just say... ""I"" ) believes that ""we"" my brain and I, are the two faces of the Universal Currency... destruction and creation.
I, when my brain stops to work... will be dead... or just the same as to say... if I'm dead, that implies that my brain is dead.
It's like...

""Elvis left the building!!!!"""
"Squid tentacles will continue freaking out when you put them on a grill, too. I'm not sure if that's because of a pain reflex or because the heat causes the skin to shrink, thus curling the tentacles (kinda like how a fillet of fish will curl as it cooks)."

"There have been people who have literally survived a shotgun blast to the brain. There are several people walking around with only one of their brain hemispheres and are fully cognizant and have no mental disabilities. There are plenty of animals that live without a central nervous system at all (star fish, jelly fish, etc.). Technically speaking, you could hook up a headless corpse to a bunch of sophisticated machines that send electrical impulses artificially down the spinal chord to keep its heart and lungs breathing sort of like the reverse severed dog head experiment. "

U don't need salt or wires just find a daddy long legs in your back-yard and rip of its legs they will continue to move without being attached to anything
This guy is awesome and always blows my mind
"Michael, I just stumbled upon your Vsauce videos and I have to say... I am so impressed with your presentations!

"I personally believe that the concept of ""self"" is contained in the brain.  You are your brain.  When you have serious brain damage that irreversibly alters your personality (e.g. Phineas Gage) you have, in essence, become a ""different"" person.  Now, when you have damage that removes your ability to speak, (e.g. Patient Tan) you aren't necessarily a different person just like an accident that removes your ability to walk doesn't make you a different person.  Does that include memories?  If I lost all my memories, am I a different person?  Well, I believe that you are since it is your collective experiences that create the type of person you are with your likes and dislikes, tendencies, etc just like if I cloned myself (or had an identical twin) that had a completely different life from me, being raised totally differently, we would be totally different people.  "

"A freshly decapitated head can live for up to a minute or so, but you'd loose consciousness within a few seconds.

"I think you mean Nickolas Coke (who died november last year at the age of 3). He had a condition called anencephaly where the big brain or cerebrum does not develop.

Funny that the brain you have as a thumnail of this video has a disease you can see it in the convolutions
"Actually, it is theoretically possible for an AI in a computer to simulate your brain once its been connected to the right nerves, causing the AI to think its you, even though you are already dead.  Also, your memories could be stored as an AI, allowing 'you' to still control your body even though you are already dead.  Therefore, you can still do everything you can do right now, without a brain..."

We attribute ownership over our brains because we are something more than our brains. We perceive and experience qualia simply because we are more than our bodies, we have souls. This is the basis (not an exhaustive proof) for why I believe there is more to the universe than what atheists believe."

"You don't ""need"", you are your brain."
"The concept of ""You"" applies to all of the personality, memories, and actions - that are created/activated via your brain. Therefore, ""you"" is not your body, it is your brain - your body simply allows you to interact whilst allowing your brain to remain active. With that said, if you were to remove ""your"" brain from your head and replace it, ""you"" would no longer be alive. The body would no longer be ""yours"". It would belong to the person represented by the new brain in your old body."
"Probably science will get to the point were you can ""backup"" your memories (the content of your brain), and put it in your ""new brain"" in case of transplant,
In my opinion, even then you wouldn't be the same person as before: just a copycat (but is still better than going straight underground, i guess). "
"That's the general thought, yes. All of your memories are stored in your brain, by your brain. Your body doesn't really have anything to do with your personality, or ""who"" you are."
"If you had a brain transplant, would you keep your memories and in theory, LIVE FOREVER?!"
Clicked my fingers a lot after watching this XD
"If possible, it would not be a brain transplant. It would actually be a full body transplant. The insecure guy would be the one waking up in a new body."
wow. my dad sneezes like fucking over 9000 miles per hour ... -_- so annoying.
"I could while away the hours, conferring with the flowers, consulting with the rain"
"if i only had a brain....
"
Vsauce created Wikipedia ;)
You know!
"in fact, if a brain transplant really did occur, it would be more likea  body transplant, rather than a brain transplant."
"you, as in your center of awareness, is either relocated or erased upon death (brain death).
so if you got a brain transplant, then the person whos brain got put in you would be what was experiencing.
so tectonically if you got a brain transplant, it would be the donor just getting a body transplant and you being killed in the process.
your brain is you, not just your memories."
"Ya, I need my brain to eat popcorn, too
*Pops popcorn into mouth*
see i ate it"
"Well... like he said in this video: Is your brain you? If my brain was transplanted into your head, then i assume I'd have my memories and everything, like the memory of who I am/was. Meaning I'd be me in your body. "
"I saw a video where a little two year old boy has no brain whatsoever. Was expected to die within the hours, but he lasted 2 years now."
I like how vsauce makes great videos even if the subjects answer is very obvious
"Agreed, don't forget to capitalise!"
You 2 are giving me a headach O_O
"I wouldn't. This guy gets off-topic faster than I do, and I have ADHD. I have to say ""Why Do We Have Two Nostrils"" is the only video of his I was actually satisfied watching. He didn't pop up from off-screen too much and he answered the question quickly and clearly."
"A DoTA players and  LOL players walked into a bar the dota player said, ""league sucks"" the other couldn't deny :P"
Imagine if your body died but your brain is somehow alive. You make transplant and your brain goes to new body. Are you going to have new body and the person with the body is simply no more? O_O
You can run for president in the US...HAHAHA
"I would imagine that we would have to actually perform a brain transplant to find out, but I don't think we quite have the technology to do so, yet. But that is an interesting question. Would we be performing a ""brain transplant"" or would we be more correct in saying that we're performing a ""body transplant?"""
"Look around his chin. There's obviously more there in this video than there is in his newer ones.

Just let me give the guy a compliment, man. If you don't understand why I gave it that's your problem, apparently 96 people agree with me, so it must be correct."
They wouldn't have any of there own memory's. Think of it as a computer hard drive and putting it in another computer.
"You're talking about Cellular Memory? I just researched it a bit and I'm not sure what to make of it. It doesn't make sense to me, and I'd have to research it more before I form an opinion on it, but thanks for bringing that up. "
"To be entirely technical, YOU ARE the brain. That's you, the brain, everything else follows your command. So a brain transplant is more actually like a body transplat, you put the same person into another body.
But it can't be done, with today's technology....and thank god."
So... technicly... to frogs dancing is a no brainer? 
best guess if someone were to die and to have their brain transplanted int another body the person whose brain it was would continue to live. but just in a different body. Meanwhile the guy who was getting the new brain would die... I dunno though thats just speculation.
Yea the transplant idea is doubtful but the reason people are freezing their brains is so they can implant them into machines/robots. Ultimately making cyborgs. 
All body systems and organs are controlled by de brain. So there is nothing u can do without de brain apart from being senseless.
they may have different 'mental' memories but there is also 'physical' memories so while their 'mental' memories might change or disappear all together the 'physical' memories will remain completely intact. 
or would you just be the dead person in a new body o.0
I feel normal 
hahaha
"i can vote.
"
"You get a new brain = You aren't YOU anymore, you're THEM. 

YOU are the brain. Your brain uses your body, like a person using a car."
"The person who's body it was would have their brain anymore so they would not be ""there"". The new brain would have the body, so it would be like the person who had the new brain got a new body."
I've seen it happen.
"It would be whoever the brain was before they got transferred, so it's really not a brain transplant as much as it is a total body transplant."
"Let's take Joe's brain. If you put his entire brain in your body in place of yours, your body wouldn't be yours anymore. Because you are your brain.

On a more interesting note, if you transplanted only half of Joe's brain, weird things would happen. I think they would not intermingle, not without a corpus callosum (The gateway between hemisphere), so you would not have access to his memories or consciousness. You would be body with literally two different, independent minds."
You should be a teacher
You should be a teacher
i think i would pass every class if you were my teacher
"The brain is one of the most complex organ in the human body. Yes if we are able to do a brain transplant you would have all their memories because we have a part that keeps all of our memories and child hood, also the frontal lobe of the brain has your whole personality. 
"
see what im saying.
"And it is now VERY apparent that LOL players do not have brains, or souls, because you always have to snap back and defend your game."
lol
Or would the person that has died be the person that gets the transplantation?
i dont believe its possible to get a brain transplant because the brain is programmed to send signals based on a specific body
pause at 2:11 omg (swedish)!
probably. Thats why people get their brains frozen in liquid nitrogen.
"With both the heart now known to host enough neuron and neuronesque cells to engage in learning; and given some of these cells arbiter in hormonal and other even fuzzier emotional states: a cooperative state is required for what counts as us. Other areas of the body are even richer in neurons. The ""gut"" has a rougher neural net that's been found to sometimes literally take on the excess thought process if the brain is overtaxed. 

Takes a bit more than cellular thought to comprise our being =)
"
lol
"memories are nothing but magnetic energy that dissipate after death its like a hard drive on a computer only we cant reboot
"
"Given the complexity of the brain, anything other than your own would probably get rejected by the body. Not to say you could ""splice"" or ""mesh"" bit and pieces from other people but probably not the entire thing. If you did happen to pull back some ""memories"", it would probably be in the form of vague deja-vu or when you are asleep. Or you might get every memory. Nobody has had a brain transplant so it is all speculation.  "
That is if brain transplant was even possible by the way lol. I don't think it is.. yet
"If you get a brain transplant would you have all of the other person's memories and knowledge? Like.. how does that work? 

Like for example if someone who was insecure and died, but there brain was still able to be used for transplant and put into another person, who the receiver also be insecure? Would they have any of their old memories?  "
oh my god
yolo swag
"Hey, Vsauce, Michael here!"
Heart: our boss is dead! Oh... shit.
I lack to see anything below his shoulders.
"Obviously you're wrong.
I do play LoL. by the name of ""Kidincred"". I find it offensive to say it's a no brainer because you can't just go afk the game doesn't play itself.
You do actually have to put some effort into it, strategy (placing items buying the items best for you using your abilities wisely pincers etc) is a huge part of it and teamwork also takes effort.
And if what I previously said isn't enough the average player has atleast enough of a brain to communicate, so it's a yes brainer."
so if you have a brain transplant you are ( by that logic ) another person

Good point there

"I think that the left side would probably have a greater chance of survival than the right. Even though the brain is important for e.g. breathing, the heart is also as important. When you think about only the right half, a heart won't be there to pump blood to the rest of the body. If blood can't reach the cells, they'll eventually die. The left half might survive, but then we have to take in to consideration of all the other organs. But, the way technology has been evolving, you never know! "

"The body can live without a stomach, spleen, 75% of the liver, 80% of the intestines, one kidney, one lung, almost every organ from the pelvic/groin area, and even half a brain. However, for starters cutting half of a brain out will not present the same person you once new, they may have a personality or memories, but not like they used to, they will not be able to form the same tasks either. With only a 500 character limit I can only answer so much, but you can use your mind to figure it out."
Im guna say no becuz I think that cutin sum1 in 1/2 wuld cause tew much inernul bleedin. 
the right side would die instantly because there is no heart and the other side would lose to much blood
You can also have an orgasm without a brain as that physical reaction is partly controlled by your spine. You do need a beating heart though.
"then il donate my testicles to the guy doing pain olympics , DO NOT Google that if your a man , dont make the mistake i did"
God I wish he was my science teacher
"Depends on if the person is cut entirely in half or cut their brain in half then cut off the part that doesn't require the removed brain portions. The brain controls opposite sides of the body (at least for arm movement) so if you cut them completely in half they wouldn't be able to function on the side they have - also you'd have to compensate for the removed arteries, the removed heart and digestive systems as well as other regulatory systems. It also depends on vertically/horizontally..."

It was a neuro-biological scientist (or something that sounds very similar, basically a mad scientist) who was working for Stalin.

Monkey survived and kept its personality"

"actually If you were decapitated youre brain still functions for about ten seconds so baisicly you can think my faking head was cut off
"
Blinking is a reflex after decapitation.
So if I am only my brain could it be possible to take my brain out of my old dying body and be rewired to a new healthy body and still live with my personality? Given the fact that my brain cells stayed alive.
turns out that when you are decapitated you not only die within seconds but you are conscious. There was this scientist back when and his friend was going to be decapitated. So when they chopped off the head he was going to talk to him and he had told his friend to blink if he heard him. So the scientist talked to him and the guy blinked...

"Actually there's a story of a group of pirates that were caught and sent to execution. The captain begged the judge not to have the crew executed. The judge said that his head will be cut off and then if he can run past any of his crew (who were put in a line) after that, those will live. Only one crewman was executed and that was because he tripped the captain because he wanted to go with him. I think it's because motions we do often (like running) are not controlled by the brain."

I heard a story once that a scientist was sentenced to death and he was to  be beheaded. so his final experiment was to have his assistant count how many times he could blink once his head was removed and as the story goes he blinked 14 times. 
Is it just me or does he look chunkier in this video compared to the new ones?
"I was thinking this the other day. you are only your brain and your body is only the vessel that carries it. better yet you are only your conscience the regulator of your sub-conscience where the power to do stuff actually lies. it's almost as if there is a little deal between them, a ""I protect you and you take care of me"" deal.

Kept alive without external input, I would agree with the assumption that our brain would move into a more introspective dream-like state.

"In 1928 a Soviet scientist named Sergei Brukhonenko managed to keep a dog's head alive using a primitive heart/lung machine and taped it responding to stimuli like light shined in it's eyes, him banging on the table and even feeding it a small chunk of cheese. This shows that it is possible to live as a 'head in jar' but the only sensory data we would get is what we can sense using just our head.
Some quadriplegics live only as 'heads' being unable to feel or move anything below the neck."

"(cont)because the brain had made a virtual world, and when you move your eyes it moves the world over and then just adds the new things it sees.
dreaming is the same basic thing, dreaming is this virtual world mostly unfettered by sensory organs and unanchored to reality. so a brain kept alive would likely do what it always does: think and dream."
"we would likely perceive the world the same way we do when we sleep...we would make it up. our brain doesn't show exactly what our sensory organs sense, instead it constructs a virtual reality in our brains which happens to, on most occasions, correlate with the real world. there was an experiment some time ago where they paralyzed the muscles in the eyes of a volunteer and had him try to move his eyes and explain what he seen. as he tried to move his eyes he seen the entire world move "

"So what would happen if our brain was totally cut off from the rest of our body, but kept alive by some super-advanced technology? How would we perceive the world, how would we think?

That`s true :D Smart idea.
Is he fatter in this video
I like the sound at the start that kicks in when he questions himself
like you
Does Michael look a bit fatter when he has more beard?
"Yes I get that. You actually outline my point. If you got rid of all the cockroach brain-stem-equivalent it would also die. If you ask why they both survive, the answer is the same; they both had enough nervous tissues of the CNS to control basic homeostasis. All the two examples do is highlight the physiological differences between insect and mammal and highlight our assumptions around what we consider a brain to be and do."

"MAYBE. it would have to be a very, very, very powerful virus and our body would run out of energy quickly."
"The answer is the egg. The Tyrannosaurus-Rex evolved into chickens and those chickens laid eggs. so the chicken was first. however you could ask ""which was first the Tyrannosaurus-Rex or the egg?""."

It needs thousands or millions of years. I am not a biologist that (*In-translatable*) into functions so, any living organism (out of organs?) made out of cells so they reproduce like most (all) birds, with a shell. (Irrelevant information) Jesus, that was difficult."
PC still better than both. :3
ok.
"A much simpler explanation is: The question never stated that it is a chicken egg, therefor it could have been a dinosaur egg, and of course the dinosaur came before the chicken."

Why would he make the same video twice?
"Correction, it actually offers a lot branches off of the original question. For example, did the chicken egg or chicken come first? That may seem stupid, but since it is so vague, it be like Vsauce to work with that. There are a lot of details to play with here."
"I believe he already has, if not ASAPScience has also done one, they are great too."
Very lame.

"What came before the chicken and the egg?

Oh, and by the way, since your brain is your hard drive that controls all your other organs and comprehends your reality and memories, good luck trying to stay alive if someone takes it out."
According to evolution the egg came first that egg was laid by a fowl that was 99.999999999% chicken DNA. I am paraphrasing of course but i would like to see a video like this some time :)
"I heard from somewhere it's the chicken, because the fibre from a chickens egg or something can only come from a chicken... It could be wrong though."
WTF

"There's no need for a long explanation about who came first, the chicken or the egg. The obvious answer is the egg, since the last mutation or diferentiation in the DNA of the chicken's ancestor to become an actual chicken would happen in the fertilized ovum that would be laid as an egg."
"So your nerves can react faster than your brain? Wouldn't that make for a pretty cool first person shooter designed mouse/game controller, where when an enemy enters your field of view in the game, it shocks, or pinches your hands. Wouldn't this cause for a much faster reaction time? And could be marketed as a ""FPS skill enhancer""."

2) I just asked a highly popular question that can go many ways about answering based on different perspectives.

chicken you quite dont know evolution the wrong thing is the questin itself because you just looking today and not past its need millions could also be tousands of years i am not a biologist that onl cell get together and then specialize into funktions so as any living its an organsimen out of organs out of cells so they then produced like most birds a hard shell because they used to nest up on trees so if they fall down they dont broke smashing on the floor that of evolution createt eggs
"Neither came first, the organism and the trait of egg laying came about slowly through evolution. It is like asking whether a human baby or a human came first. "

I really love your videos. However now the first time I saw some misunderstanding about who we are. 
And a simple thing is that you are not your brain. Not even your thoughts, reactions or even your soul. Because as long as you say ""MY"" (brain, thoughts etc...), that's not you. That's yours. So what we are is, something you CAN'T say: ""my"". We are what is all behind this. Who is aware of our thoughts and uses our body to exist in the 4 dimensional World...

"Personally i don't think it is possible; it's certainly an interesting concept but the brain needs a constant supply of oxygen, which comes in the form of blood, the cells of which have been given oxygen by the lungs, pumped round your body by your heart. However, I believe that it may be possible to keep a head alive through the use of a very complex technological life support system which utilizes artificial ""blood"". But i think keeping a human head alive in just a jar is impossible."

"The brain named itself.
Think about it."
"If that was possible, wouldn't we already know if that we are the ""brain"" or not? I mean, if we were actually the brain, wouldn't a brain transplant would put our ""mind"" into a different body or a different person into your body?"
I saw on National Geographic a long time ago that the Nazis conducted an experiment for a brain transplant on two monkeys. They took the brain of a live monkey and put it into a recently killed one. They got the monkey to come to life in the body of the new host but it died within minutes. 
yeah a head transplant the brain was also transplanted :P

"are u sure you are not mistaking head transplant with brain transplant. the fact that it is unethical is not the reason , more likely  it is the level of difficulty to connect all nerves,vessels of one`s brain to another in like 3-5 min so that the brain tissue doesn`t die..."

Uhha herr ehh meeeeh
I remember my granddad (by marriage) once told me a story of during world war 2 he and his friends used to kill and steal chickens from farmers because of the rationing (He is italian so it was in the northern italian countryside) and he said one day he jumped into a field and grabbed a chicken by the neck and stretched it's neck to kill/suffocate it but it didn't die. anyway the farmer saw him and shot at him (missed) but the chicken just started running around with a now elongated neck

I don't think this video was terribly necessary. Most YouTube commenters are fully aware what one can do without a brain.

"Only a couple of their brain functions work, it is possible for zombies to exist, but not yet at the moment. It's like, bringing the dead back to life, but not really. The brain of a zombie tells them to eat, and the ""zombie"" itself is actually a disease, that's why once one is bitten, they become a zombie too. The disease will pretty much shut down every single one of your body function, you're half dead, except that one part of your brain.

Dear Vsauce what would it be like (hypothetically) to live as only a brain?

no..........
"Wasn't this video called ""what is a no-brainer?""?"
you should explain what dreams are and how the body does them because I find it amazing how we are able to dream and how the body decides when the dream starts since you can't close your eyes and see the dream start since you are not aware of the dream until you realize you're dreaming. If that makes sense
"no, i actually watched a whole documentary about it, he didn't seem to give a shit, he was fine"

When decapitate, the body is dead but the head is still alive for a few minutes.

"Parker, it's comments such as those that make him want to argue with you. You just said you hoped ""God will SAVE Jim"" Save him, as if he is doomed. I believe in spirits because I have encountered paranormal attacks and such. But I do not believe they go on into heaven. I think sometimes they wander the earth at an unrest, get into another life, (More like reincarnation, but with no real purpose just living another life.) or sometimes even just nothing at all happens."
"Regardless, Jim has very good reasons to why he believes so as well. However it was rather rude. But he is correct in many ways. "
"I do believe there were times that Jim was pretty disrespectful but he has a lot of points. But then again so do the people he has argued with. I have very specific reasons to why I do not believe in this ""God"". In fact, I wrote an English paper on how he did not exist and I did get an A+ on that paper too. Because I have legit reasons, and research to support why I do not think any deity exists. But I was focusing on mainly ""God"" because he is the most famous of deities."
and it's only getting longer :)
"do you ever get tired of repelling to the same comments?

"I can't believe that throughout all of of these comments, none of the Christians mentioned that the original question that started all of this isn't even valid, it is our souls that go to heaven, not our brains. This debate/argument or whatever you want to call it needs to end. We can't convince each other to change, if God wants to save Jim or any other non-Christians he will. I will be praying that he will. Also jim if you have something mean to  say about me or my religion, please don't reply"

"Terrible analogy, we know for a fact that 2+2 =/= 5. However, nobody knows exactly what will happen when we die, but you try to make it sound certain that an afterlife does not exist.

"In my opinion the conception that ""YOU"" is the brain / soul is to big of a assumption that has taken into account in this clip.."
The question was the interesting part
"First of all, i like your channel.

""YOU"" are your whole body, not only your brain; so that isn't the discussion.

And the things that happen after you are beheaded can be compared to actions of a rudderless ship.

I would have liked more practical examples, not the salt on the legs that's just a chemical reaction.

An example about a chicken and a cockroach isn't answering the question as well... those are different organisms, they all function in different ways (especially without a brain).

You can become a politician without a brain...
"yesimstuntdude answered it perfectly. You say things are proven wrong, yes that's right, scientists will always say they've made a mistake if they have, it is the religious who refuse to acknowledge any other plausible answers, as not to admit that they believe in nonsense. For instance, many christians still claim the world is only 6000 years old, when we know full well, in the 21st century, that it is billions.. they cover their own eyes from actual facts in order to maintain their delusion."
"what? don't be silly lad, faith cannot improve your health anymore than wearing a sombrero can lol, that magical productivity of the immune system is known as the placebo effect, watching comedy can make you 'feel' better but the medical problem will still be as bad. that's the reason faith healers don't work in hospitals.. theyre lying bastards."
"That's a broken analogy. Over time, as we understood lightning better, it seemed more and more plausible. However, conversely, as we learn more about the universe, the possibility of a god seems less and less plausible. The fact that we now know there are deterministic physical laws in the universe effectively limits any plausible god to an initial creator, anyways."
"A philosophical question – what if we could manage our mind like a computer, erase bad memories (for example break up with girlfriend/boyfriend) , should we do it? Without bad memories we could be happier maybe, BUT still it’s an experience which makes us what we are  and without it we could be doomed to repeat those mistakes. If you could, would you do it?"
"That's called the placebo effect, and it is not specific to faith in god, or even faith, or even best applied to faith. It works much better if the person has good reasons to convince themself that they will get better, or especially if they take physical medicine, even if the medicine has little effect. In fact, it's been shown that simply taking pills, even when the person knows that the pills are placebos and not real medicine, helps them recover."
"To be sure, the bible is certainly made up in that sense, but I agree, that specific comment is simply recounting a biblical story."
its also a biblical story
why did everyone dislike this its in the bible his not just making it up
can you actually prove there is no god.....i mean in 1000ce it would've been inconceivable that we could harness electricity.. some of the worlds greatest minds thought the world was flat just a few things that were strongly believed but proven wrong.... so as it is now god is pretty unbelievable but we never know what will or might happen in the future...by the way I'm 100% atheist 
actually faith can do a lot like children believing that they will get better will often result in their bodies particularly the immune system working more productively not as a result of god but rather their belief that god is helping... so yeah but I'm still an atheist

"Well then again, if you didn't have a brain you wouldn't be alive, therefore you couldn't die since you were already dead."
"and as far as your theory, i think absolutely! i have always wondered if you could switch two people's brains if breaking and reconnecting that many connections was possible at our point in science. it'd be quite an amazing thing to do. but remember lots of things are like he said based in the body. hunger, anger, i believe adrenaline. it would be neat if there were a way to connect a brain to senses and nothing else. then we could finally find out."
"think about something else. if we are according to religion spirits inside a body how can changes in our brain affect how we feel? just think about that. it means either who we are doesn't mean shit because it is all determined by our brain and we will lose all memories and personality when we die, effectively making even going to heaven a death in every way, or all spiritual religion is false.
have fun feeling hopeless."
You can get elected for president without a brain.
"Cool theory dude, I Enjoyed reading this :)"
"I'm just going to share a theory with all of you...

think about yourself. Is it you yourself who is you? or is it your brain merely riding a vehicle that is your body? Because if your brain is left without a body, can it still think? If it can, then you are yourself, a brain, just like everyone else...

You can get elected for congress without a brain.

"You can die without a brain.

That's a no-brainer."
You are so facinating
Google(algorythms) can see if you have viewed the ad.
they get paid based on how many adds get watched..... 
It hurts just reading your grammar
Well youtube (google adsense in fact) pays him proportionnaly to how many ads have been seen. Krisbeem is right ;)
"No it is not. AdBlock is the thing that will eventually make us pay money for youtube, and the internet at all.
I hate every people on this earth who uses Adblock, because that egoistic and egocentric person will cost the very me money."
Believers don't care about the bible or truth for that matter.  It's just people who have not accepted they won't live forever.  It's not about some bullshit relationship with god either.  They are simply in love with immortality.
You should actually read the bible.  Most don't actually read the thing.  And when you do with critical thought.... you get a knot in your stomach.  Wondering how people actually abide by all of this nonsense and run their life around it.  You realize life is a cartoon for many.  That or they really haven't actually read it critically thinking-- they might be over taken by the early modern English. But reading it just makes wonder about humanity.  How insane it can be.
"why didn't he say ""no you can not live without your brain"" instead of waisting a lot of time."
"Seriously?  First, ""Using big words wont help you become any smarter.""  I really don't think he used very big words at all.  And ending with ""Sorry Charlie?"" Is the icing on the cake. It was like some politician I've seen on television.  No critical thought going on in the brain at all.  The absurd is very funny.  Thanks."
"I hope you're right.  I'm on the fence with it.  If it is the case, some discovery of evidence will occur.  Only possible evidence of us being separate from the brain are people with near death experiences and reincarnation like memories.  The closest scientific study I've found Robert Penrose theoretical physicist and Stuart Hameroff anaesthesiologist concerning microtubules using quantum entanglement. But what we know of entanglement casts serious doubt its occurring in the brain."

"Incorrect, with adblock you effectively block the money that he would've earned from your view. You also remove any chance of clicking on the ad which removes the chance of Vsauce gaining the CPC he might've gotten from you clicking the ad.

"You really shouldn't use adblock, it totally destroys youtube's business model. If you like that videomakers get paid to make videos for you, and that you don't have to pay a monthly fee for youtube, don't use adblock."

"to not believe in chance is also to disbelieve in the many many trials and errors of evolution too, 99% of all life that has existed, is now extinct. To say chance had no part in it is asserting that a concious decision was made to create everything, or at least whatever triggered the 'beginning'. To say ""we know"" how it all started (like most religions do) is arrogant. All evidence points towards natural chance and probability, not devine power and magic- we humans invented those silly concepts"

"no one questions the existence of the Israelites(although their involvement in Egypt is in dispute), no one questions the ebb and flow of power shifting in the ancient Middle East. No archaeological finding has disproven MOST of the OT. In fact, the OT is used a lot in finding where ancient cities and locations might have been. Not to mention that the Pentateuch was the MOST holy thing that the Jews had, beyond the Ark. So they were meticulous in making it accurate and precise."
"I am on the fence with evolution as I do not want to abandon centuries of orthodox for a new theory. And don't say that evolution has been empirically proven, as there still has not been a recorded instance. The way I see it is the empirical evidence for an old earth and quantum fluctuations creating matter. From this, evolution makes more sense in the timeline rather than six literal days. 

And while Genesis may not be historically accurate, the rest can be. No one questions David's existence,"
"You merely said the Bible didn't contain any truth, and I said it did. And perhaps you should learn what an ""Ad Hominem"" Fallacy is. It is where you discredit the individual rather than his argument. Now, your statements so far urge me to inform you of my personal position. I am an Old Earth Creationist, meaning I believe in God, evolution(on the fence), and I agree that the majority of Genesis is probably religious fiction. However, the rest is very reliable form a historical standpoint."
as opposed to all other youtube comment sections? :/
what am I preaching? 
"Well, the problem with your first assertion is that there are humans in the Bible. This fact would contradict your claim that it contains ""[nothing] resembling actual and factual history"". Also, the fact that there existed Babylonians and Israelites. There are a lot of rational reasons to believe in a deity(no reason to stress), there have been logic chains for the existence of a deity(Kalam-Cosmological Argument), and there is evidences of the Bible's historical accuracy. And nice Ad Hominem..."
"GOD DAMN COMMENT CHAIN!!! Oh my god, so oblivious they're making they're own religion look like assholes.(im atheist) Youtubes an idiot. Well, most of of the members anyway."
"I just don't like that people get all offensive on the religious subject.
One can believe anything he wants alright, that doesn't mean is productive, useful or true, in fact it may be even harmful to other people, like, very harmful. 
Believing in a god with no evidence is the same as dismissing the scientific method in which our society ultimately relies.
Religious individuals often piss on what gave them the life their ancestors could only dream about and that they enjoy having, science. ..."
So every time you get hurt a cell dies so you live shorter
"One thing to give an opinion, another to preach..."
@jim jimjim okay when did i say that?? I just said that non of us are acheiving anything in this.
why should I?.. am I not entitled to say what I believe?
@aussie bloke We would start to divide (more than now) and there would be a massive civil war. We would all be killing each other (more than we already are) and only because of the ignorance that we would have. That enough?or do you need any more reasons why you should stop attacking religion?
"@aussie bloke science will also be questioned, everything humans have discovered over the years will be undone every theory that has been made will be pointless. We would all be confused and ignorant because we would have two explanations for everything and both explanations would have equal evidence."
"@aussie bloke look that's the whole point of religion or faith: believing in something that may or may not exist that may or may not be right but they still believe in it . If religion was a fact, if everyone knew that it really IS real, then there would be even more people questioning it."
"@jim jimjim well it's not YOUR problem, deaths and suffering happens for many reasons and religion is just one of those so justt leave, religious prople reading this aren't gna suddenly going to become against their rwligion because of the crimes that a few deluded people have commited."

"This is the longest YouTube comment chain I have ever seen in 4 years of watching YouTube videos, and it's probably the stupidest and most hilarious, I tried ending this conversation once but I'll try one more time
Why can't we respect each others beliefs as long we do not force it upon someone.  It is OK to have different beliefs, as long as we still respect each other. Because we are  people. People with diverse opinions and we should just admire that person for sticking up for their beliefs"
"Well, I'm a theist, but I'm not going to argue on a clearly nonreligious video. It's like going to a Mexican restaurant and debating over mining practices with the cashier. It makes no sense..."
OK this is geting really stupid. Everyone shut up. I don't know where you are from. I am guessing the UK or the US. In both contries we are aloud to belive what ever we want. We should all just respect each others religions and move on.

Click for a long conversation chat.
"so thats it then? people should just be left well alone when trying to assert these silly things?, sorry but i think it becomes a serious problem, its unethical to say the least when somebody even wants to exist forever, that just seems like lunacy to me, along with the set rules and commands to blindly follow something known only in reality as a character from a book.. To just push aside everything else that can give you a clearer answer like modern astronomy, physics or biology, is ignorant."
"That's pretty mean, but at the same time probably the best line i've ever seen on YouTube. Hahaha I laughed for like 10 minutes"
"so where do you draw the line? would you ever step in and say someones faith is boderline insane?. what about a parent that refuses to let her child take medication because its 'gods choice' to inflict that suffering?.. what about the muslim kids that are taught ONLY from the quran? and killed for doing otherwise. This type of shit is always on the news, yet you think rational people should stand by why the delusional tell people how things are and how to live? like with abortion and euthenasia "
"look, i dont understand what youre stressing about, you said youre an atheist right?.. so you too feel that such claims of an eternal existence is complete nonsense, being that it literally makes 'no sense' in relation to the real world we live in. You probably want validated and provable answers to things before you just accept it as fact, especially one as big as OUR LIVES. Now, if somebody is blatantly following a singular outdated source for their claims of fact, that is far from intelligent"
"so youre offended.. offense doesnt do anything,- you just said to me ""youre one of the worst people ive ever met"".. does that offend me? fuck no, say whatever you like lad, its youtube. you should call the police!!!... i called someone stupid!!!! life in prison awaits me for sure!!!

Subing to vsauce IS a no brainer you hand and eyes will sub by themselfs :)
"ermm..you might want to read up on how forgiving god is towards those who 'repent'.. ive no reason whatsoever to make these things up, i am questioning the morality of the bible, with the bible- i am not afraid of an invisible monster. Why are you telling me to stop replying to people? just go away, you dont need to worry yourself about this."
yet none have been 'deleted by the author' it seems... vsauce are wise you see.
"this isnt spam, i reply to people who have commented to me, just like now. if you dont like it, just look away, its not hard, im doing it right now as i type- its that simple!!!"
live in the moment?.. where else am i supposed to live?
"the bible clearly shows throughout, especially in the old testament, that god kills millions, the devil kills 10.. thats just how it is... the quran also claims that a man flew up to god on a winged horse.. should i believe that too because it says so?."
"at what point do you say somebody is delusional?.. if i said to you, ""i read a book, it says there are wizards and dragons and unicorns in the clouds, it must be 100% real because i read it, and others have too.. it says you should believe or you will be thrown into a bucket of glass, wasps and shit forever"".. would you think im a sensible human? or just fucking mental?"
"lol thats a scientific theory of a religious nature- they do not go hand in hand. god didnt secure the earth very well, without our big brother jupiter our planet wouldnt be here, it pulls in millions of meterorites which would kill us all otherwise. thats not mentioned in the bible though, neither is the fact that the sun is just 1 of billions of stars.. religious 'teachings' are insignificant."
"humans have been around somewhere between 100,000 and 250,000 years. where did you get 2-3 million from??? and no, god does not love humans, the mosquito alone has killed billions of people, bacteria is always evolving and our immune systems cannot keep up, this is what god has given the people he loves, pestilence and plague."
"and there inlies the problem, if god did show his big beardy face, there wouldnt be other religions, there wouldnt be atheists, we would all know he was real, but instead of doing that, he gives us a book, 1 book, to explain EVERYTHING :/.. your god sees all, yet does nothing to save the suffering babies in this world- that means either your god is useless, or just does not care."
"or, maybe jesus was just a human- that makes more sense than him being magic. tell me, if one day you have a daughter and she says that she is pregnant, with gods baby, will you just accept that as a possibility?...will you just accept this immaculate conception as the honest answer?..""brings himself back to life"".. fuck man, are you serious?.. what world do you live in where that is possible???"
"there is nothing wrong with enlightenment, thats just a search for knowledge. its when you slam the door shut on any other probabilities and assert fact on your one singular, outdated belief, thats the opposite of seeking enlightenment."
jesus hung around with 12 dudes (whos feet he would wash).. and no women. 
"if someone strongly believed, and wanted it taught in schools that 2+2=5, what would you say to that person?.. would you just accept that because its what they think? or do the right thing and tell them its a stupid claim?"
"Sounds like you're the one who has disregarded scientific advancement. Consciousness is a separate entity from your brain and it survives physical death! 150 years of research have gone into this, from prenatal memories, after death experiences from clinically dead people / autoscopic NDE's, verifiable past life memories, and OBE's from people during sleep. So maybe you need to acquire some scientific knowledge and ration thought."
"cheers pal, i shall continue my quest :D "
"1. why do you care?, this is youtube, a public forum for all sorts of shit, and believe me, what i have said is nothing compared to the horrible things people say here.

2. i comment because i find it ruder to not reply at all than give my honest opinion.

3. NOTHING i have said is as evil as what the said 'consequences' are for not jumping onto the jesus bandwagon.

4. all followers of other religions go to hell says the bible, but a rapist/murderer who repents and accepts jesus goes to heaven."

"6)Bodhisattva's achieve the state of enlightenment by studying their whole life, so do you really think its a good idea to stick to a firm belief your whole life, and be religious?  i grew up a christian went to church but notice how most of us sorta stop going at around 12, that because we realize its all bullshit. church is a way to teach people how to be right and wrong in a code of human ethics, but we killed the teacher of the most proper ethics, oops. look at the facts, its an old method"
"5)people think they understood Jesus, but they, being good little fucking stupid humans killed him, for breaking ancient Jewish law, the Romans killed him out of ignorance, and to show you guys what you could have been taught he brings himself back to life. he was an enlightened Bodhisattva, someone who can do very powerful and amazing things by being a master of their own reality. if Christians really followed Jesus's teachings then maybe the crusades wouldn't have happened.

"4) we have accelerate the rate of resource drain so much that we will never be able to survive as a race any where near billions of years. if god wanted life he would have put life that can sustain itself, and always be there, for as long as hes alive. if there is a god he will realize that making a fucking tonne of people rely on just faith, creates a problem and just showing up one day might fix it. god sent Jesus instead, who showed us the power humans really have, he was not a god."
"3this being said though, why would god love humans more than anything on the planet, they do things that are unnecessary to their survival, and thus cause themselves and life on planet earth tip out of balance. what if were really far back in the universe, so far that god doesn't even know were to find us, and by the time he gets here, life in total will be over. in terms of time the universe has been around 13.7 billion years, and humans, have been around for 2-3 million years 2013 of which"
"2change is an inevitable action in the universe, and knowing that critical thinking a skill learned at age 12, can help us realize many things about god. if god created the universe he probably had a plan. the most efficient way to make life would not be to literally make it in his image and do all this shit for 7 days. he would program physics and put in certain elements into the universe. he then allows a universe to automatically build itself and watch all the creations he made"
"1I read this discussion and it seems 100 percent ironic that this discussion is taking place in this video about not having a brain. you come forth with only logic and everyone else is either too hurt by the comments or is ignorantly straying away. no one laid any good counter arguments, and even though you were rude, who the fuck actually cares its a website. religion was only a primitive way to keep everyone from going into chaos, now we have more developed systems and the church is obselete"

I'm an anti-thiest myself, but I don't go around saying shit like ""You're religious, that makes you stoopit lawl ha ha returd!"", unless someone else tries to start shit, or says something that even most religious people would consider legitimately fucking stupid.

I then awaited sensible responses but instead the replies and 'answers' i got were nonsense, so i replied accordingly. and that 'you will burn for eternity' claim is just fucking horrible.

"so now im not allowed an opinion?, on something that makes no sense to me or many others?.. must everybody just play along when things like ""the world is only 6000 years old"" are being said?. call it whatever you like, but to me the worship of a genocidal maniac to recieve an eternal existence just seems like delusion. You may not think i am going to hell, bible says i am, along with most of the world. If god was real, there wouldnt be any atheists, right now god is a figment of the imagination."

"You say that God does nothing to end the suffering of the world but how can he without taking away the very thing that makes us who we are, the ability to choose between right and wrong. He didn't create the world the way it is now, the acts of wicked people are what causes all of these things. And he will put an end to all of this one day, but to allow good to exist without suffering there will have to be judgment. Good cannot exist without God because it cannot endure without him to uphold it."
"The 10 commandments themselves don't say what punishment each 1 warrants, at least not that ive read, and yes the old testament law was very strict in some cases, but the whole reason Christ came and died on the cross was so that anyone no matter what sins they've committed can be forgiven and saved. Christ throughout his teachings says that many of the old laws should be honored but they aren't damnable offences. He says that anyone who believes in him shall be saved."

Which God exactly?
"The laws that God gives us in the Bible are things he expects us to obey, but if a person truly is unable to do some of these things because of where they live or the society they live in I believe God will understand, afterall compassion is 1 of the 7 spirits of God. He doesn't give AIDS to ppl, the nature of the world we live in causes these things. And there are times in the old testament when God has judged entire cities but if there were any people that were not wicked God spared them."

"not at all, yes it is sad when people die, that is why we mourn and celebrate their lives by remembering them. To exist forever would be torture itself. This is the only life we get, knowing that makes you value your own life and the lives of others even more. Our lives are a brief moment of existence then the inevitable return to non-existence, its what life is. We just die."
"I personally am a Catholic, and proud of it. This does not mean that I disrespect atheists or any other religion. I don't even believe that ""non-believers"" go to hell (if there is one). You could say I am between Catholicism and Atheism. jim jimjim, you are entitled to your opinion, sure. But why make such a big deal out of it on youtube? Why dis catholics so much  that you have been mean and, I think, vulgar to other religions? You believe in something, as do we. Keep your opinions to yourself."
"You see, by bringing ""Sex"" into this conversation you completely butchered your argument you're avoiding religion or creation beliefs you're just trying to avoid evidence to live your life as you wish, but you see if everyone did that the whole universe would collapse on itself (Metaphorically). Now sex before marriage - on to your subject - as Christians we don't ask for you not to have sex, we ask you to wait until marriage, that way we have a civilized and aids/STD free community."
This is amazingly accurate.

Bust as soon as i begin to use rational questions and basic logic, you literally run away from the conversation. I bet any money you will contine to comment here, but only to those who dont beat you with simple common sense."
"I just think rational thought is good.

you think that because you believe in 1 of thousands of different religions, you will somehow defy the laws of nature and be concious forever, be it in your body or not... You assert this based only on the words of translated scripture from 17th century england. 

to claim absolute certainty from such an insufficient source of knowledge is arrogant and extremely bias. You have disregarded both scientific advancement along with every other worldy religion."

For example, this can of soda I'm drinking won't last forever, it probably won't last more than half an hour, so why do I drink it?

"We were discussing why it's important for people to debate religion. That's a very broad topic, with many individual points waiting to be made.
If you'd like facts, you're going to have to narrow it down. Most peope usually begin with a question."
Finally a good christian on the internet 
"i have a question; not long ago in england, a woman refused to give her dying son the medical treatment he needed, this was because she was a devout christian and thought it was gods choice for him to be this way, do you think its perfectly ok to have that belief? or do you think she was delusional and that child shouldve be given the treatment? ..im  just curious of how far you let peoples belief influence the lives of others.."

"Stop trying to continue the argument, he's not trying to preach to you so stop trying to preach your belief to him. 
I'm an atheist but everyone should be able to believe what they want without being insulted, he's trying to stop the argument so now you have no reason to keep it going. "
"After a few comments in that debate chain, I gave up because I knew it was just going to go around in circles."
"To be insulted is subjective. To insult is a matter of intent, and I guarantee you they had no intent to insult you. If you are insulted, then you made a poor inference.

Like I said, everything they believe allegedly comes to pass after you're dead. Since you don't believe anything happens after that point, you have nothing to worry about. You two can treat each other just fine while you're alive, and nobody has any reason to be offended."
"to be insulted is subjective. I take offense from christians assuming they follow the correct god... in their eyes billions of non-believers are going to spend an eternity in hell.. that is what they have to think... they are mentally disturbed and fucking morbid. Anybody who actually wants to EXIST FOREVER is a fucking moron, especially if its next to a genocidal maniac."
Actually... you are yourself the brain. We just use this body so we can communicate with other brains. The eyes are the only visible part of 'ourselves'.
I just want to scratch his beard :D
"Well if you think about it in terms of the God vs Lucifer thing, God wants to have you, but if you give in to Lucifer's temptations, he'll snatch you away.

I don't know. I say you guys shouldn't take so much offense to what Christians are saying. As long as they don't badger you and act like douchebags, their beliefs shouldn't irk you so badly."
"If his belief entails you burning in hell after you die, and you don't believe in hell, then what's the problem? Just tell him you're not worried and move on. There's nothing in his belief that requires you to shit all over him."
"For the record, they aren't INSULTING you by saying you would spend an eternity in hell (which by the way isn't even their right to judge. It'd be up to their god to decide). So you're calling them stupid to repay them for worrying that you might go to hell and trying to help you avoid that."
WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
"What Can You Do Without a Brain?
silly question! nothing!"
"Actually for Christians and Catholics, God loves everyone regardless of their state of mind towards religion and reciprocating. It's more of a sad love that a parent has when trying to help their rebelling child, but it's a complete unconditional love. 
For actual Christians (not Westboro-type), ALL people of ALL religions are and should be loved and accepted.
For myself, I would rather have a benevolent, forgiving God to love back than nothing to look forward to. But you have opinions too!"
"Personally, I'm not a fan of religion (including atheism), but according to christianity, you don't have to believe in God to go to heaven. In the Bible it says that the people who don't believe in God, yet don't sin, go to heaven. While the people that do believe, but resent him, don't have much of a chance.

I think the Bible contradicts itself though. God doesn't give us peace, he gives us freedom, so no reason to pray. Yet, sending his 'son' to save us defeats the believe in my opinion."
"In my opinion, you may go to Heaven and have an eternal life, but why try your entire life to get to a magical wonderland. Instead of doing that, make your life, right now, your own little piece of Heaven. :D
Live long and prosper Motormouth. :P"
"I can just end this horrible argument here. If ""God"" created us, then he created us with a FREE WILL to believe whatever we wanted, we can. We should not just be a jerk to anyone who believes in something different from our own. Religious debates are pointless because regardless of what each side says to each other they won't let up because they believe in that religion."

There are much more polite ways to express your opinions than on a Youtube video that has absolutely NOTHING to do with religion.

"That's a very nice, comfortable way to understand the Bible. Unfortunately, it neglects the very real reality that everything aussie bloke said is completely true, whereas you want to preach a castrated version of Christianity that is simply not true. "
"No, you have never read the Bible it would seem or at least have never understood it's basic New Testament principles. Firstly, Purgatory is purely a part of Catholocism, not Christianity because it is not mentioned in the Bible in any way. Jesus did not free everyone from Hell or render it impossible for humans to enter it; he simply forgave everyone's sins so humans were not necessarily condemned to Hell for committing sins. You still go to Hell if you don't accept Jesus as your savior.  "
NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT YOUR GOD. -Sincerely Atheists...
"You know what I believe (as a Catholic myself)?

I believe that if a person is good, and if they do good things, but they do not devote their lives to God, they will go to Heaven.

You see, God won't make you burn for all eternity if you spent your life helping others, just not in the name of God.

But, if you go around spitting on the names of every person who believes in God, then NOBODY WILL LIKE YOU-- and, in my belief, you will go to hell if you do evil."
"I would agree with it, but I'm too busy giggling at the fact that Motor was very respectful this whole time and everyone else was just shitting on him and he kept his cool +1 internets Motor."

"you ppl make it seem like the bible is the be all do all, its about interpretation of scripture and the word of god, until we reach hell or heaven, u wont know for sure wat it looks like, the bible also says the world began about 6000 years ago, most christians dont believe tht.  at the end of the day, it is thru faith tht we can be saved, but its useless to believe in god and be evil towards others.  im pretty sure god wud prefer a nonbelieving good man than a believeing douche

"I'm trying to respect the guy who has an image of some man in what I hope is a speedo, and it's working. Sort of. First off, God worked in in-direct manners, and the last he truly intervened was with Jesus (or with Muhammad based on different religions.) First off, that's human error, not God's error, we all deserve our own opinion on things. It was clearly mentioned, just not everyone knows about it. I mean, I've never read the bloody Bible, have you?

Didn't think so."
"It's a shame your God couldn't have made it clear the first time. Then there wouldn't be so many people bickering over their own idea of what the Bible says.
I'd expect God to have been smart enough to forsee such turmoil and take steps to prevent it. BUT, he just couldn't manage it.
Fail God is fail."
im not religious but is it so bad to believe something if you wanna believe something go on ahead its good to believe in something if your not religious you just believe something else besides a religion like believe in raw fact some people just need to believe other things 
"Yeah...while I respect what you're saying, no-one is in hell according to the Christian Religion. If you sin greatly, you spend longer in Purgatory, but Jesus freed everyone in hell, and then went back to Earth, which is when he died for three days and rose again, during those three days he liberated hell. Then he went to Purgatory, then to Heaven. No-one goes to hell according to our religion anymore.

Just saying bro, you make a good point, it's just not religiously correct."
"Because religion exists. So, something's gotta be done. :-/"
"That's precisely where you're wrong. Some of us DO have facts, and many things ARE possible to know.
THAT is why we spend our time debating religion. Intellectual debate is what helps our society to progress. It is a true sign of ignorance to wish for everyone to cease stirring the intellectual pot in favor of stagnation."

Because of religion. Lol.
"thts cuz those christians are uninformed, ignorance does not constitute an entire religion being farse it just means tht those certain ppl have to be re educated, history and religion coincide with one another and many things from the bible can be proven to have happened as well, so make sure u do a lot of research b4 u make these false statements
"
"stop sayin tht, its not true and makes no sense, not all christians believe tht, we believe that heaven is for those who deserve to b there and heaven is for kind ppl who want to b with a person like god, whether u believe or not does not determine whether u get in.  In fact, if u were as morally sound as a christian person is, ud probably get into heaven b4 him, because despite not havin the bible and other sacramentals u were still more righteous than one who did
"
"It's hateful in saying that people are idiots in believing religion, and that they're condemning people to hell. And contrary to popular belief, hell isn't a lake of fire, or really fire at all. We have no way of describing it other than eternal pain because it was never described in the bible. Plus, how about Christians who love, or at least tolerate most people? People thus far have tried many means of calming/debating in a civil manner to you, whereas you have struck out."
"the 1st 3 commandments were not made to glorify and worship god like fools, y worship sumthing tht doesnt exist? it dosent make sense, and it is rude.  also, wen u were a child, did u refer to ur mother or father by their first name, probably not, so y wud u do the same with the creator of everything?  the commandments were not put in any particular order by god, but by some human, and we decided to stik with the order, dont try to make it seem like murder is second to god and respecting ur mom"

"U are actually hate filled for religion, thts y u go to such extremes, like i said 1.1b catholics claim tht thru being a good person u will go to a place wher good ppl reside, but thru bein a bad person u will go to a place wher bad ppl are, its like a girl gion into a boys bathroom, it dosent work and dosent make sense, god gives us free will to choose wher we want to go, its all about wat we DO, not wat we believe"
"This is untrue, god always loves us, the idea is, do u love him back, and its not loving god specifically, its loving life and people jesus says tht wat we do for the poorest of those we do for him, he doesnt want us to get on our knees and glorify his name for hours, he wants us to learn to love each other, and if u cant do tht, then u dont deserve to b with other ppl who do in eternal happiness, in this world u cant live for yourself and then ask god for eternal happiness"
"Well, actually, there are *specific* gods which have been proven not to exist. These include...well...every single god we've ever dreamed up in our history.
Having said that, what you are employing isclled ""Pascal's wager"", and it has been refuted numerous times before. It fails to take into account the fact that, if God exists and is omnscient, he will know that you're only ""believing"" in him to save your own ass. This makes you a false-believer, and condemns you.
Not so logical after all."
Please no.

"Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death (Deuteronomy 17:12)

"people fear not existing anymore, they need outrageous tales of eternal life and magical worlds.. this aids their fear of death, all at the cost of blindly following a man in a dress while throwing aside any logic and rational thought."
which 'backup' god should you believe in?
"i dont think ANYONE is going to spend an eternity in hell.. unlike religious people.. who assume most of the world are going to be tortured forever for not being as naive as themselves.  

which is worse?: calling somebody stupid for asserting fact with no evidence.. OR saying that they are going to be sent to hell, cast into a lake of fire where they will be in eternal pain forever and ever?... which of these is hateful?... i do let people live and let live, nobody dies in the name of atheism."
"Every. Fucking. Video
There's always a religious debate.
Why can't people just get along?"
"Jesus CHRIST, you guys are dumb. How about we all agree on some basic facts:
1) There is no way to prove that God exists
2) There is no way to prove that God does NOT exist
3) If God does exist, and you don't believe in him, you burn for eternity.
4) If God doesn't exist, and you DO believe in him, nothing happens.
5) Therefore, common sense dictates that you should believe in God, if only because of a ""risk/reward"" analysis. Believing is taking the ""safe route""–there is no downside."
"Not everyone is such an extremist, much like the fact that many aethists are so..... hateful as you. Most people just live and let live."

"You're 100% right, but, the bible says God created man to honor him. So if we dont he'll get rid of us..
Like if you took some girbles and put them in a cage on a wheel to make you power.. You feed them, give them water, and life, everything, and you want power in return. If they dont work though, you'd get rid of them and get new girbles. See what i'm saying?

"Honestly. All that talk about jesus is fucking pathetic. That was what the people thought more than 2000 years ago to  have an explanation of the world. All these amazing things in the bible. If they would happen now then they wouldnt be special and the people who lived 2000years just had no explanations for them. Religion just makes war if humanity wants to move on, then religion is not what we need"
I read the whole conversation. After that i realised that the video was over.

"which god? why is the christian god the ONLY god? why not krishna... who claimed to be the one true god THOUSANDS of years before your god did.... face it, you are a christian because you live in the west, had you been born in india you would be saying THE EXACT SAME about vishnu or ganesh. Had you been born in Iran you would be saying THE SAME about allah. Had you been born in ancient greece you would be saying THE SAME about zeus. There is nothing original about christianity, especially jesus."
"a species does not last long if it does not fear death. Humans have feared death for as long as we have existed, its not hard to imagine that death is not the end- hence the earliiest religions. now if you use rational thought and logic, you will learn that once the brain is dead, there will be no part of you left to experience anything- people didnt know this thousands of years ago. They just assumed that human like figures chose to make everything.. This answered their curiosity, until now."
"so because you cannot explain the origins of things, you just assume 'god made it'... if we are so special then why do eagles have better vision than us? why can cheetahs rus faster? why do tortoises live longer? why can a tiny tree frog kill 10 men? ... we are not special, we are just another organism.. a tiny acorn grows into a huge oak tree, that still does not confirm that someone chose to create the universe."

"The christian view is not that we are somehow better, but that everyone would  be going to hell because a holy God cannot let sin into heaven, but that Jesus loved us so much that he died to pay the penalty for the sin. Now he just gives you the option to be forgiven if you want to or just keep going the way you were going...so in reality God doesnt send you anywhere....you choose where to go, so it is a story of love, not hate. "
also go to proofthatgodexists . org whic shows that there is no morality or logic without God.
"And sorry, but one last thing....if you really want to know whether God exists, just ask Him. The bible says in Jeremiah 33:3 ""Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not."" So i would suggest you just tell god that if he exists, then to show you, and just in case there really is a God then you will have an excuse why you dont believe in Him if He doesnt show you..it might not be right away, but he will reveal himself if you earnestly ask."
"Another reason for my faith can be demostrated by looking at your computer. If i told you that your computer had no design to it and slowly over time the parts just assembled themselves to make this amazing machine, you would likely say im insane. But look at us humans..how much more amazing and complex we are..there is clearly a design to all this,from the eye to how plants have properties to heal us, to how we can be moved to tears by looking at the nature around us..look at a flower or a baby"
"Hi, i dont want to argue but ive been reading this fascinating debate and i would appreciate if you would kindly listen to my view with an open mind and i will give you an example of why i believe in God. First of all, if there was no god or spirituality then why does every human at at least some time in their life feel the need to search for whether there is at least some divine entity? i think its because we all somehow inately know that we were created otherwise this wouldnt concern us so."
"You try to respect others beliefs yet you insult it anyways. What your perspective of christanity is incorrect also, that is the reason why we are stereotyped so much is because no one can research some damn details before we make conclusions.

What the bible promotes is forgiveness, love, and all that is good.

What people interpret it as is a powerful being who does whatever it wants. And if you love anyone in this Universe, then you love God if you are christian. I would go on if I could."
"I clicked through it and read it all and honestly, it wasn't worth it. "
"do you not see the human flaws in the christian god?.. the reduculous ego, the first 3 commandments are desperately trying to get you to belive only in this 1 god, to never follow another god, and to never make yourself to be an idol. The sheer fact that these are the 1st 3, and murder is 7th.. tells me that the people who came up with this shit, really really don't want you to think for yourself, especially seeing as the punishments for the 1st 3 are death. It is all too primitive for me."
"i said ""yes -brainer"" to my friend and he told me to shut up
"
"This is a lie, because there are many Christian communities, normally seperated into Catholic and Protestant, and as a catholic, we are not taught tht we are better than others, thts like presbyterian, maybe lutheran, we believe god loves us all unconditionally, and tht the path to heaven is not paved by faith alone, its through our good works. i think an all-knowing god would understand that humans are rather dumb creatures and live off of customs for the most part, any1 who is good is accepted"

"moral of the story: if you say something about religion, you automatically start a world war.  now time to start WWII, if god did exist (which it doesn't), it wouldn't give a fuck about your lives so there is no point in praying since christianity is complete bull shit."

"You could read it a million times, that doesnt make any of it true, not without sufficient evidence to back up its wild claims of talking snakes and miracles..I see tons of hatred in the bible, stories of genocide,slavery and eternal suffering.. I cant see how that god can be considered as 'loving'.. The admission price to heaven is your adoration of a mass murdering egotistical maniac.  80% of americans believe in god, many of who think jesus will return in their lifetime..DELUSION is the word."
I actually got to the end of this
"indeed, this blind faith is becoming blinder by the day.. the more we discover, the more hatred is shown toward modern science. People fear science because it doesnt just take 1 answer and give up searching for more...like religious followers. ""oooo the bible says this, therefore anything shown to us from then on, must be wrong, because the bible says so""... its shockingly ignorant. The vatican even accepted evolution for the fact it is, not to long ago, yet i know many christians who refuse to."
"its is not ok to assert superstitious belief as fact, especially if that belief points towards the eternal suffering of those who do not believe. Its easier if we all assume NOBODY goes anywhere after death, its easier and far nicer if EVERYONE just ceases to exist like before we were born. Of the 2700 religions in this world, they all claim validity on what they believe.. THEY CAN'T ALL BE RIGHT... but they can all be wrong."
lol published on my b-day
Wow youtubers are petty
"It's ok to believe in something, it's ok to not believe in something. Not everyone will believe in the same thing. Don't call people stupid because they don't believe in the same thing as you. That's rude and disrespectful. If you still can't accept that and be tolerant of others' beliefs, just shut up. It'd be easier for you and everyone else. Good day."
I wonder if you could live without a body...
"don't worry about christian logic... Having A figure as a central figure of your faith, who is claimed to have died, as a sacrifice for all sins ever committed by humans, freeing them. The sole fact that believers still think they will go to hell, shows that they even reject rules of their own religion and certainly will not accept any logic outside of that therefor.

not even the vatican claims that hell exists. Those people just repeat what they have been told as a child, refusing to rethink."
"so if i firmly believed that you were going to be tortured for eternity in a lake of fire, and not only that, i though you deserved it... would you not be entitled to tell me what a horrible belief that is? would you not be entitled to point out the stupidity of such claims?"
most of the content in this vid is very similar to a radio lab episode.

What is it like when you are in a coma?
"I feel the same way, remember ""God is Love"", and wheter you are crhistian, cathiolic, atheist, muslim or dont give a fuck, we all believe in love, because we love people, your family and your dog, or your playstation haha, dont believe in God or god, belive in love and the will to do the right to make this world a better place "
"Two examples of having no brain: Saying ""Swag"" or ""Yolo"". Playing CoD and thinking it's the best game, and then using that ""Swag"" talk."
just let people believe whatever the fuck they want. It doesnt even matter.
"No brain = No costom actions or reactions nor concience, wisdom or resistance (a.k.a.: Will) but mareley instincs that are mainly desighned to protect itself, like how cars now adays have sensors that stop the car automaticly when their's a potential obstacle in front and you dont notice.  The time tour body keeps these instinct involuntary ways to protect itself or react to the elements depends on the remaining energy in your body.  It will continue like this like it's programed to do so by DNA"
"this guy is coooool
"
"I beleve another way to see this is that we are basicly robots, made with biological material, our brain contains (along with DNA) who we are, our individual reactions to our envirelment, what we find aceptable or not etc. these reactions are caused bu the chimicals in our body and information costomly stored in our brains, if we have no brains US wiuld no longer exist, yet some independent parts of your body still have stored energy, but these are mareley the biological extent of our procesor."
"Yeah no problem, although I do not like your religion I don't see how that would justify me bashing out at it. Most ""nonbelievers"" point fingers at Christians when it comes to labeling out barbarians but there are idiots in every group since most of them have tried to force their thoughts onto you. You seem like respectful guy so your religion suits you well and I don't see why you should stop believing."

Maybe he aint helping us because he aint happy with the world now he doesnt like what we do so probably if we were better some deceases woulnt exist
"No I didn't because it seems pointless to me but throwing out swears left and right signifies a low vocabulary since you cannot find any other strong word to use. All I want to do is help you get a point across to someone by not using what is considered ""vulgar"" language. 9/10 people who aren't being insulted in an argument tend to listen to what the other person has to say because it is done in a polite manner.

Ummmm I didn't catch the answer.  So a no brainer is not possible?  You are only your brain so therefore yur body is only what u control and not who u are so when u have no brain there's no brainer cause u is not your body.  Or at least that's what I got outa that lol
the story of genesis is in the old testament... which contains the first mention of god and what god made.. are you saying that the story of genesis isnt a belief of yours too?.. that you deny the claims of the gospel?.. it seems you are no more a chrisitan than I.

"""If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.""(Leviticus 20:13).. its pretty fucking obvious that the bible was written by sadistic, uneducated bastards.

"does that not apply then? because its confirming the importance of the 10 commandments, which you said : ""The Ten Commandments have always applied since they were etched onto two stone tablets"". so lets analyse this part of scripture and see what you think- should disobeying your parents be punishable by death?, should homosexuals be put to death? or even enveous people???..

Without a brain you are still yourself because what makes you you is your memories. People who have had replacement body parts have gained memories that the donor would have had.

Without a brain you are still the same person because (not sure if its true or not) your memories are not just stored in your brain but all over your body.

"An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence....... To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.

Yea but don't make fun of them please my girlfriend believes in god but is not very religious.

Stayed home from school today......Well I had Science Class.
Need to get some frog legs.
The brain named itself
7:04 I sense a paradox forming...
"hey vsauce, are souls real?"
"Shiiit that thing about the skin is creepy. So basically, I am a brain living inside something i've created, that has a mind of its own? A symbiotic being..."
"Does the fact regarding the heart about it not needed the brain to tell it to do it, apply to your lungs as well?"
There is a baby with no brain but I don't know if it is still alive. It's been alive for at least 2 or 3 years
It'd be cool if Vsauce did a video on religion... hint HINT.
"that's right, nobody can believe about this quickly. Listen, it's way easier than i thought do a few surveys and boom a few $100 extra in your bank every week. i found it here: bit.ly\ZuEyjf"
That was the greatest thing I've ever seen...
what about the reverse a brain without a body suspended in bio-jell or in a robotic suit with the ability to supply nutrients so eyes mouth and a robotic suit add and remove organs at your delight 
better than homework
"love the freaking backround music
"
"well a no brainer would be ... rotting xD
also anything not connected to the nerve system (like our imune system) would meet that condition (even in a life subject)
of course also anything that doesn't have a brain to start with (single cells or cell colonies for instance)"
Actually without a brain you could still run for Congress :P

That's because you're an idiot.
"Or rather the Universe gaining conciousness & looking back at itself - thats you & me. Heres where good VS evil comes in, it is ALL experience for the Universe so whos to say if something is right or wrong? I think as our own constituent parts we make this call ourselves & hence why it is so important to look at history, science, philosophy etc. from ALL points of view before deciding or condemning. Your interpretations can be shocking as long as based on truth BUT remember Karma, as to actions!"
"Yup, school is run by fools and robots (in the classic Czech sense)."
"Life, Human conciousness in particular is just the Universe having evolved to *this* form at *this* moment - what we percieve as being solid reality , a 3-D world around us is simply energy vibrating at different frequencies, becoming chemicals, DNA, becoming biological carbon based life (maybe there are other kinds we don't know?) and evolving from here - the brain is the most complex physical object in the Universe (as far as we know), its a supercomputer - the Universe looking back at itself."
I think this would be a good reason to skip science at the end of the day.

We generally consider our body and anything our genes told us to create as ""us"", however the only part of the body that makes the distinction of ""us"" is of course the brain.

These people are kept ""alive"" by machines and still show involuntary reflexes, and some movement. Men even have erections (or so I am told)."
I've read the same. But this is not an example of a no brainer. The blinking is most certainly controlled by the brain. These experiments only help to understand how fast the brain dies when severed from the body.

"The percentage of the brain that isn't used is very very small. Basically, the only parts that aren't used are the fatty tissues that don't have nerves in them. It has been proven several times that we use all of our brain, but not all at once. Every part of your brain is responsible for different things; site, hearing, smell, touch, taste, memory, math, emotions, etc. However, they are only active if you are using them, and they increase activity the more you use that part of the brain."

"This reminds me of a news story I heard once. It involved a boy who was born with no brain. (Small parts of the brain stem had developed, however. Kind of like the headless chicken, I suppose.) At the time that the story was broadcasted, he was already two years old. The child could move and did in fact have basic responses to outside stimuli.

Yes, zombies are very possible. Please do not create any. "
"Depends on what you consider a zombie. A living person could be lobotomized so heavily as to walk around drooling on himself and trying to eat anything that moves. A dead person could be hooked up to an electrical circuit that applies direct stimulation to the muscle tissue, making a remote control zombie.

Witness: No.
Lawyer: Breathing?
Witness: No.
Lawyer: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive  when you began the autopsy?
Witness: No.
Lawyer: How can you be so sure, Doctor?
Witness: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.
Lawyer: But could he have still been alive nevertheless?
Witness: It is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law somewhere."

"Not to animals, but if we think of how evolution most likely happened, then the appearance of sentience was probably an adaptation of the body because it needed greater intelligence to take care of it in harsh conditions. I think of the body as a symbiotic society of cells who work together so they can feed, live and reproduce for longer. I also think of sentience as an evolutionary mistake, because it enables the brain to make the body kill itself, so in that regard, the body could be a slave."

"There are people who have lived without a physical normal brain, look up hydrocephaly or dandy-walker syndrome. These are cases where the buildup of fluid in the brain is so severe that the brain does not form normally, and instead brain cells form a thin sheet at the base or around the insides of the skull. One person with that syndrome actually had a high IQ despite having a head of 95% liquid. They have brain cells, but no ""brain"", as we know the traditionally shaped organ."

"Basing your life on religion and science is mutually exclusive. Basing parts of your life on science and other parts on religion aren't. For example, you might believe in some god or gods, and science hasn't disproven the existence of a god. I think, at least. Religion isn't necessarily DISCARDING facts and evidence, merely operating on things where there ARE none qualifies. Such as, god or an afterlife. They may seem unlikely to you (and me) but you can study science and still believe in them."
"yeah, they do.
My statement was not appropriate. And I'm sorry for that.
The right statement would probably sound something like this: ""Religious people usually don't like science"""
Good for you :)
im not religious but my parents are and i know for a fact that your point is incorrect. my parent's vicar was a scientist and apparently most of the science teachers at my school are religious in some way. not that i care but science does prove some parts of the bible.
"After this video, I went and made a Frogs Legs dance party."
You should ask that to nicki minaj
yeah...
"Yes, a few other Christians liked his comment, but nobody else gives a shit."
Vsauces videos make me feel small . . . . 
"Isaac Newton, Galileo and even Charles Darwin were Christian. And Albert Einstein was Jewish. 
The worlds greatest scientists were religious. People can be religious and support evolution you know. It's not the pure dominion of atheism."

@Michaelara95
idk y people watch this shit
"Fellow YouTubers, Debating is one of the WORST ways to try to bring somebody to Christ. The best ways are prayer and love, which if you do neither, it leads to hypocrisy, which turns people off from God. It doesn't matter what evidence you have for God, in this case, it's His job to prove himself, not yours. In Exodus, Moses would tell the pharaoh that all these curses are going to happen and they did, but it took God softening his heart to get him to let the Israelites free."
*Because there are God who still people in people
If only everyone could be as you :)
"Because religious people believe all the scientific answers are truthfully written in a 2000 year old book with the intelligence of someone from that time (eg. the bible states the world is flat, if god is all knowing, why would he say that?)"

"I'm religious, but i love science :D. I don't think science nor religion(religion ain't the same as God) can get the whole truth by themselves, so I try to conciliate them, and when it's not possible, i separate the science hipothesis from the religious one, and consider both POSSIBLY or partially truth"
*Because there are people who still believe in God.
Because religion and science often conflict with one another... I side with science :D
religious people don't like science...
That explains why bush was foolish lol
"A determinist, simple."
Becuase there is still people who believe in god.
i dont like vsauce3 but i love vsauce and vsauce2

And there you have it folks! what can you do without a brain! Come back next week for more amazing quotes!
There was a women who got her head decapitated. When asked about the surgery she had t get it reattached she said that she could feel her head slide off her neck 4 times.

"That scenario doesn't astound me as it once did. I don't claim to have thee answer, but I think that if your memories/idiosyncrasies are intact (and you are alive,) it is as much you, as you currently are right now.

"I have always wondered why someone with a broken neck can't move their limbs reflexively, I mean, it only requires the spine, not the brain, right?"

"Your genome is prone to mutation but your body is constantly fixing it. If there was a huge change in genome, you'd have severe consequences. Though skin cells and RBC don't have a nucleus, they were formed from cells with DNA at one point.

"Let me add a note for you; your ""Skin cells"" are dead, so it has no nucleus, so it has no genome. Also in RBCs ""Red Blood Cells"" the nucleus decays in the third stage of its creation, so it also got no genome.
And over all an average of 3-4 mutations per year happens to the genome of a human in some cells and not all of them, so your genome isn't constant all the way, so I guess ""You're not all of You"". :)"

" . . . because it seems to me, given what is said on the video, that our corporeal body isn't necessary to sustain a mind. If our brain receives nourishment, then the ""jar"" question could be true; that if our brain is in fact wired to a computer, then our body becomes components of the computer. What doesn't change is our mind, with the capacity to remember more (hard-drive). This raises a question: Take our brain away; can we transfer our consciousness to a sophisticated network?"

Once my dad chopped a head off a snake then threw it in a fire and it kept on moving for some time .-.
I'm spending my birthday watching Vsauce. Birthday well spent.
I love the shape of Michael's head.
"Vsauce, I know that you probably won't see this, but... /watch?v=WMlVNFpzKNI Could you explain this? Is this like Mike's case, or different?"
@gamerboy4500. No its possible to be born without a brain. Usually the babies don't survive. Sad but true
"What can you do without a brain?, nobody uses their brain these days anyways."
Woah they just got 2000000 subscribers
Mind=Blown
Would you be you after a brain transplant...... 
(-(-(-(--)-)-)-)
"No
"
I want to thank Vsauce for making me a smarter person. Well more knowledgeable at least (;
Because the addiction to the computer instead the boring-ness of school makes you pay attention to electronic devices. ;)
Spot the point where biology becomes philosophy...
"lol :) true that .. and in school, its all about learning to live  but not what life is ... "
@vsauce great videos and presentation tv show is in order and in the uk to please.
Wen he showed the hands the one at the back was jokes
The cockroach...right when I'm eating...
He is your science teacher!
You have very descriptive eye brows.
You HAVE failed English. 
"Didn't this used to be called ""A Real No-Brainer""? New title is nice though."
i want him to be my everything teacher
Go swimming in that lake.
Jeffery dhamer's Zombies :|
i learn more in this 8 minutes than the whole 6 hours of school
So gross
Your brain is still sending signals to your digestive system for it to work. They aren't conscious decisions but technically your brain is involved. 
bill nye vs vsause
Me fail English? That's unpossible!
me too! =)
This made me feel a little bit more insignificant.
so zombies are possible jks

Who else snapped their fingers at 2:30 ?

how did that chicken survive ? even if it can leave without a head it will bleed to death
Is the headless horseman a no-brainer ?
A baby was born without a brain just the stem. It was supposed to die in hours. It is now 2 years old......
"Well, the way you structure sentences shows you didn't pass English with more than a C. Your sentence should have been like this: ""Oh fuck, because he forgot a ""d"", that has to mean he failed English. Sad kid."""

Does anyone know what his qualificatiosbppp
Why can you do without a brain? Let's ask how the majority of people on the internet do it.
"I know a lot of people who makes decisions and talk while not having a brain, explains please......"
We are science
"nope, 478 people have no brains"
I don't know if this is real or not but I saw a video that showed a 2 yr old boy livin without a brain
wonder what you've got in physic in school :D
fascinating. thanks mike
I want Michael to be my Science teacher.

"First of all great show, but talking about no-brainers, can you do a Zombie as in Romero's zombies episode, i know it's fiction, but up to how much?
Fact vs Fiction vs a posibility in the future.

that's a starter."
like if you snapped your fingers after he told you how fast it goes ahaha love you mike
What's the song at 2:50 cause it doesn't seem to be Jake Chudnow's?
And you failed English.
"Brain is YOU, your true self. And the body that you possess is the vessel that your brain needs, inorder to interact with the surrounding. if there was a device that could place your brain to someone elses head without mistake and connect everything perfectly,you'd have a different body, but your the body's immune system could try to reject the foreign matter but there won't be the brain to do so, because the your brain would be giving the command...."
i have a feeling that Michael would find a way to make it very interesting :-)
Will you marry me Michael?????
"""dead"" (no heart beat/brain activity) zombies are impossible. 
""infected/rage"" (cognitive prepossess in brain shutdown only thing turned on is hunger/rage) technically not impossible. "
Let's test this in Gears of War
Many of your pain responses don't actually make it all of the way to the brain. Like when you put your hand on something too hot and you instinctively take you hand aways before you actually feel the pain. So most likely the chicken would react to pain but it would not actually feel it. 
Those actions take no conscious thought but they are still controlled by other parts of the brain. 
no. your brain automaticly makes you breath and you heart that pumps blood out in your body is also controled by your brain because of signals. every heart beat is an automatic reflex your brain makes(sorry for my bad english)
Wait...isn't breathing and pumping blood a no-brainer?
Mmmmmm what about a lizerds tale
I wonder if that chicken could still feel some pain
"I think, I AM myself consisting of my mind/soul/conscience whateveryouwannacallit and that ME owns my body with its cells and muscles and stuff. My body's hormones and my synapses and receptors are the diplomacy between both parties and the bacteria in my gut and anywhere else are...parasites, guys that i let or have to let live somewhere in this system but they better behave and contribute! or else..."

remember south park when they said when you die you shit yourself haha
that music creped me out at around 2:50
"bad idea to watch this on your lunch break, great video tho!"
It worked but my head hurts now
"Yes, you would still be you, you'd just have a different body. What he means by ""you"" is the real YOU. The essence of being YOU, what it feels like to be you and have your thoughts and be aware of having those thoughts. That's your consciousness, that's who you REALLY are. Your body is physical and of the earth, so shall it return to when you die, but the energy inside the body that is YOU, is cosmic and eternal. You are still connected to your body, but only for as long as you live."
"Why did you Not talk about Jellyfish, they Don't got brains."
"Hey Michael,  Can you Do a Video about ""What was The very frist Living thing On Earth""
and how it came to be. Thanks for your time :D"
as soon as the music chimes in i know shit's about to get real 
I see this guy better than my school
why cant you be my biology teacher

This was recommended for me aswell
"What did you study, Michael?"
"Cool episode but I walk away asking myself things like:
1. If decapitated how long am I conscious? Could I hypothetically be aware of someone picking up my head?
2. Provided my head gets fed in some way, can I live disconnected from my body? You know futurama style?"
"Didn't the title of this video use to be ""a real no brainer""?"
because thats how ppl kill chickens and that chicken felt nothing for the rest of its life so dont feel bad
brilliancy. 
Headache ughhh
._. Crap I'm on the smart side of YouTube again.
Hey Michael could you do a video on zombies? I have thoughts that I want to know.
SALTS A MAKE HER DANCE! 
I saw that too!! (Person below me)
there was a baby that was born without a brain and as far as i know he lived a few years.

I find it hilariously relevant that this video showed up in 'related' to League of Legends VODs.

But what would it be like to be a being without a brain?
For an example if you are a bug without a brain, could it be possible to make a system that makes contiousness possible?
This is maybe a possible way for immortality, if im made of 2 parts for an example:
you shoot one half so it dies and walk away
the other half will becreate the first half

is it then you?
Yes, the contious info will be stored around your whole body :D"
No During The Mid-Evil Times They Use To Chop Of Ther Head And Ther Head Can Do 1 Of these 2 Things •Talk.•Or Move Eyes But Only For A Little While
You forgot to mention that a persons skin cells has the same DNA as the whole body. While bacteria living in the gut doesn't. Cells belonging to you has your DNA.
"why wouldn't you be living without a brain as a human? you would not be possibly born without starting a brain first, but it's a good positive agreement is to have a brain to learn :)"
I think you just proved his point.
Shuddafuckup old nerd man
"I like the title change. I thought the old title was uninteresting, and I never actually clicked on the video."
Yea that is why I clicked it. Cause I thought I skipped a video.
Ahhhh ok you got me Vsauce.. i subscribed.
that sudden picture of cockroach scared me lol
No wonder cockroaches are practically indestructible.

"hey @Vsauce there might be a video somewhere on youtube, but it's about a person's arm blocked from that person's view by a small curtain. the arm is touching a fake arm on the other side of the curtain. someone then touches the fake arm with a feather, but the person apparently ""feels"" the touch as if it were their own arm being touched. is that real and if so, how does that happen?"

hey michael did you changed the video title from no brainer to What Can You Do Without a Brain?"
Congress proves that you can still do things without a brain
Why did you change the title 
"2:38 does anyone know the song?
"
Why do we have favorite colors?
...
"Why did you change the video title ? ;D changed it to 'What Can You Do Without a Brain?'
from 'This is a real no-brainer'"
I remain highly doubtful that a brain is required to make YouTube comments.

you changed the title of this video and i thought i had never seen it so i got excited :(
no its parents did
hehe
"I know that but I mean if I could possibly change body I would still be me? if I ""copy paste"" my brain would I be me? it would have been right if every second we were a different person but that's not right I can feel that I haven't died. my old self didn't die it's me I don't feel difference but in reality new cells in my brain are created but why is it still ""me"" can you explain that :/ are there theories I could find about this subject?"
What about sperm? Sperm still gets produced even if your brain has stopped working.

Aristotle would like a word with you."
I  think he's over thinking it
"Pain is pretty simple the way i'm going to explain, you feel pain so you don't do it again, it like teaches you a lesson so you don't damage your body. Pain is also an alert for your body so you know what part is damaged so you cannot damage it anymore without knowing about it, there are many other reasons but that is basically why we feel pain."
Here is another question... What is pain?
your brain just named itself... WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS!?
"I really dislike this channel. I watch one, and then the next thing I know its 3am.

FUCK YOU VSAUCE!"
Omg. This video almost made me vomit. But I cant. Stop. Watching!!!
"No, each human is unique in relation to all other humans, not in comparison to other species. Ever heard someone say, ""No matter how many people you meet, none will be like you (exactly like you)"""

that makes you normal
you are a brain and the other parts works together with you to concuer the world(sry maybe wrong spellt concuer)

you just got unmindfucked :)"
wee dont know if wee really are unique wee just cant understand other species that well 
do you mean like in video games?

i was thinking the exact same thing..damn it
There are some technics to control the beating of the heart
My brain's named Jeff. :)
U don't say meme
Once you said Cockroach and showed the picture it felt like something was crawling up my leg. God I hate roaches.

"Yo! Michael! I have a question! And I have to yell it at you! How come humans are unique? What gives us our unique thouhts, feelings, actions, beliefs, and so on?  Why are we conscious? Why do we have souls, if you will? The brain imparts upon humans the ability to think, live, react, act, create, memorize, remember, and so on! But it doesn't, to our knowledge, impart upon us the independence and uniqueness that all humans possess! Please like this comment so that Michael sees it and answers it."
dooooooh?!
"vsauce, always a cool story bro."
WHy is it so fun to watch your videos :D
vsauce always has an answer for the stupid questions that pop into my brain throughout the day :)
How about plants and jellyfish

"What I believe is that I am a collective entity, brain, skin cells, bacteria, social status, and all. When I die, I would still be a collective entity until others are unable to distinguish me as a collective entity anymore, a.e. severe decomposition. Now some parts of that collective entity may continue living, but without the functions of the whole.
What do you think?"
"When you think about it, the brain named itself."
Leave it to Vsauce to make me question every move my body makes ever.
"Goddamnit Vsause, im eating chicken!"
Of corn.
"He choked on a grain.

"Your body is your tool, your brain is... you. "
"Your body is your avatar, your brain is your profile."
He choked on a banana he ate off the floor after it fell for around five seconds.
Mike died by choking on some food. Wonderfully ironic.
so kinda like zombies...???
v sauce should use a wide angle lence for filming you would get 10000 more views its a brane thing 
"The frogs are stuck in my head, want to gag! :'("
i have been wanting to say this for a while now... you are welcome sir
I wish Michael was all of my high school teachers.
"it was a false statment, but not a joke, it went around facebook for awhile "
is this a joke or did he die for real 
I read about it. He started choking and they couldn't get the food out in time. :(
"""If we are what our brains do"", then the same could be said about our nervous system and skin cells. The brains is more complex, but in the nostrils video vsauce claims everything we know about reality is dictated by how the brain unconsciously processes photons (sight), energy waves (sound) and molecules of different materials (smell, taste, touch). Therefore if everything we do/intend/think is based on unconscious brain processes then there would be no ""us"" at all. I find this self-defeating."
Which is why he is still devoting his life to teach adults and children alike?
"SHARING. maybe the very first step to a friendly, rational and bright future. A future shaped by justice and intelligence. No matter how, no matter what ... as long as you're sharing, another person will profit. sharing material stuff is not easy.

fuck it. All i wanted to say is: Filesharing makes humanity stronger. EVERY kind of sharing makes us stronger. think about it."

"The real mind bender: For ages, many people have wondered how we can have free will if God already knows in advance everything we're gonna do. Today, we know the world operates based on some fundamental physical laws. Since we're physical systems, we too are governed by these laws. Your neurons fire, sends a signal through your nervous system which passes into your muscle fibers, they twitch, you may reach out your arm. Looks like a free action, but the whole process is dependant on physical law"

My da's granny cut of a roosters head and it ran around for about 10 seconds while the head was still on the ground opening and closing its beak
When my grandma was cutting off a chicken head the chicken started to run around with no head and it died after 15 seconds.
he suffocated after his owners forgot his cleaning and lubrication tools while on tour. 
can you explain about the part where you say that you are the brain and everything else is not you cause it's bugging me ofcourse I understand what you said and I ve thought about it before I saw the video but there is no connection between me and my body? :/
"no, not really... is that 'spit' on ur computer screen?"

"Yes, I am. When he was little he always had a strong love for science. He would ask a lot of questions and get into debates with teachers, and then come home and search things on the computer to think about. I always thought he would major as a philosopher. He makes us so proud. :-)"
"Well basically, a ""no-brainer"" is used to describe something that is so simple to do, you could do it without thinking. But Michael here is explaining is that at least with humans there won't be literally a ""no-brainer"". Without your brain you can't do anything."

Its because he still has a brain stem like the chicken :)

"Actually, what SeqZZ is saying is somewhat true. The baby had a condition known as anencephaly where a large part of the brain and skull are missing. In this case, the baby had only a brain stem (yes, technically she still had a brain) and could not do much without life support as she was pretty much a meat vegetable. Unfortunately, her religious parents did not understand how the brain works and, quite depressingly, spent most of their resources keeping the baby alive. Look it up."

"A study a long, long time ago by a philosopher was made. He was going to be executed for his ""crazy"" ideas. He told his wife to look at his decapitated head after he'd died.

"not technically speaking. suicide is when you are the person who causes your death. Jesus knew he was going to die and accepted death. think of it like harry potter. he knew he had to die to save others, so he did even though he didn't necessarily want to, he had to. jesus prayed to god to take this task away even though he knew it was inevitable. its kind of confusing sorry haha but i hope i helped a little."

"He did exist, he was actually born. Whether or not you believe in him is your choice good sir."
It's been proven he existed and was a person (there's old Roman records) but what's for people to decide is if he was the son of God
That last part about you being your brain sounds a bit like Descartes theory of the mind and body being different. But I think he included the brain as part of the body. It's been a year since my philosophy class.
"I have a question VSauce. Did Jesus commit suicide? Because techniquelly he did know he was going to die, and continued to do it with the intention of dying. Im not religious, just curious as lets say he did exist. I think a good deffenition of suicide would be, dying with the intent and purpose of dying. If ya jump off a building, with the intent of dying, it's suicide. If you fell over with no intent, it's an accident. Someome pushes, it's murder. A man jumps in front of a bullet shot by some"

Hold up even though were not technically ourselves without our brain our unique chromisomes are intact making our bodies appart of us. Not bringing in this fact can be sad honestly. But getting more in depth of the matter is the fact that the bacteria inside us does not have our chromasomes inside making the digestive part inaccessable or litterally a no brainer.

"Thankfully, archeology and other method of historic research have helped us to dig the past up and see how things truly started."
"That's made up.

Religions evolved slowly from rudimentary superstition, building up into organized businesses. 

You can see it all the time in history. People worship river, river gets a 'spirit' the spirt becomes antropomorphic, tales about the thing are made, they change over time, until you end up with a whole polytheistic pantheon. Then, monotheism ands coming up, almost always for political reasons. 

By the time the religion is stablished, people have long forgotten how things started. "

if science is that perfect why doesn't it keep people from dying ??
"you forgot the most important fact which is ""god"" our creator who built your body and gave the strength to think and walk in a universe that he also created ,and when your following the right religion you're just following the orders of god to live your life perfectly ,who knows the creation better than the creator ? people makes mistakes but he forgive people   if they wish for forgiveness ,and you better believe there is a god or you with all do respect really stupid even if u don't follow"
"u have a strong point , so bottom line is that somehow in a really complicated way the heart works with the brain to do the thinking process and recording memories and give us the ability to recognize things , and thanks for your reply :)"
Okay then. Thank you for correcting me. Have a nice day.
that's a paradox - you are suggesting that you can say someone else cannot voice their opinion because anyone (including yourself) can voice their opinion?
"I think Leonard from The Big Bang Theory should do one of these videos one day, just to see if anyone notices... "
You being the expert on bullshit.
"a lot more then we think it does. When our brain doesn't work with the soul, like in the case of Alzheimer, we get older people who think they know who we are and have an emotion but no memory to associate it with us. When we die, our soul leaves our body.(Some would argue even 3 days after the body is dead which is why Jesus resurrecting from the dead is a Miracle) All this to say, that I think your confusing the physical heart with the soul(Which is sometimes symbolized as the heart) "
"So in reality (See other comment) something in the brain is a back up system containing the things our brain has attatched to strong memories... OR, perhaps some memories and emotions are contained in the soul...
Our brain contains personality, and everything that makes us move and our intelligence. But why did this man, who lost his memory every 10 seconds, still contain the ability to play the violin? Why did he remember his wife? 
I believe God put the soul inside us. Our soul does -c-"
"I believe that when God said that he did not mean your physical heart. See we all have the soul(I believe we do). It does contain our emotions and it contains even some strong memories that are associated with these emotions. 
Proof of this is a man who was a violin player (I forget what the cases name was but you can find it online) lost all his memory every 10 seconds or so. BUT He remembered his wife, and how to play violin. Proof that the brain does not control everything we think. "

If he though his nose would not grow when he said that, he would be lying and his nose would grow."
"That thing about us using just 10%, 15% or 20%  of our brain is actually an urban legend."
Actually emotions come from the brain. The subconcious mind as it be. For example when you dream its your brains way of decoding those emotions and what you've seen through out the day. I will do an experiment open up a word document and start typing how you feel at that time you find the words will flow out of your head not your heart. Dont forget as human beings we can only accsess around 10% Of our brain. The other 90% I bielve is the subconscious mind

"Take someone's heart out, they can still think. They'll die soon enough, but they can still think.

Take someone's brain off, and their body will last a few seconds, and the body parts quite some time, and the heart may still have a few beats. But there's no though.

The mind is an emulation created by the brain. It's not in the heart.
That's a fact. No room for ""opinions"".

When facts clearly indicate otherwise, it's not 'opinion', it's DELUSION.

Why is it that my brain still works but I don't have to think to do it?
"All mammals and birds have feelings, I think but when looking at other animals, the problem is the exact definition of an emotion. Birds may have weaker emotions than mammals but since birds and reptiles are close relatives through dinosaurs, it could be thought that reptiles may have emotions, but just weaker. Crocodiles probably have stronger emotions since they are closer to birds. Remember that humans have emotions but that emotions existed before we could be called humans. They're primal."

And there are probably many great muslim scientist who are religious :)"
Hey dude thats pretty harsh. Its not like he came up in here tryin to preach 'n' shit. He just stated what he believed to be true and that's it.
"His opinion is that the other person's opinion is garbage.  Though I tend to agree in a way, I don't just say it to muslims, instead I just feel really sad for them.  I've talked to them before and they just seem terribly controlled by their culture/religion to the point that they can't be a good person.  Therefore I don't respect the religion/culture for controlling the person."

Your body may be a student which is physically doing the actions you intend and tell it to do
Your Brain is just like a teacher, it tell the students what to do, but still gets its basic commands from someone else

NOW! Your DNA is surely the head master. It is the thing that is only unique to you, so, if this one thing is only you, then surely that is you.

I am commenting before I watch the video because that's what people do.
MANY MANY bodily functions don't require DIRECT communication with the brain... Including making comments on videos

"Well, people assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, when actually, from a nonlinear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's actually more like a big ball, of wibbly-wobbly... timey-whimey... stuff..."
But... Does it make any difference?
And what if they just run on Linux? Maybe they just use another code. Maybe there are multiple life and universe determining systems that fight each other by virus infiltration?
But then you could say the HCl in your stomach used for digesting proteins is a no brainer mainly because it doesn't need a brain it's a substance...
"Who says that life has to have a meaning? I don't believe there is any proof to show that there is a grand meaning to any of it. That does not take away from the beauty of things, even if existence is some grand coincidence it does not mean it is any less fantastic. The point about free will is that we likely do not have it, if your brain consisted of all the same atoms in the same order as mine then you would simply be me and react as I do in everything provided we are exposed to th same things"
"If one does not have a purpose to live for then they have nothing.  Nothing would mean anything.  Morals would not mean anything, relationships, being alive physically and mentally, none of it would mean anything.  Like I said before, one would be Nihilistic.  Believe it or not, Evolution is entirely Nihilism."
"Life would not have a purpose or meaning, basically Nihilism. People wouldn't be so various or have so many different characters if they were predetermined. We all have human DNA so why are we so different?  Why do some people still live naked in the Amazon while we have computers? If we were all programmed we would have a purpose would we not? Yet being programmed leaves us no purpose other than what we do not know, yet do we even know anything? It's best to live with a purpose rather than not."
WOW COOL!!! A headless chicken! :D
"Search in google : NO BRAIN, and search it as ""I Feel Lucky"""
"I think you're overthinking what I said. The idea is that a determinist goes through life to enjoy the ""plot"". That's the closest thing I have to a ""meaning of life"".

It wasn't an arguement for or against the existence of Free Will. Lol."
"Irrelevant. It's our choice to make the movie in the first place, and it was the actors and production team's choice to put it all together. So it goes deeper than the movie's plot. It's a predetermined plot, but it was determined by those who have free will to determine it for the audience"
"Does the fact a movie is predetermined make it any less enjoyable?

Hope that helped."
"An insane person is like a defective program, the program is still determined by the code, but the code is flawed. It doesn't change the fact of determination."
Step away from the internet you're scaring me
"I'd say that's pretty accurate. There's also no scientific proof or explanation for the existence of Free Will. It's mainly based on religious belief that depends on an outside factor giving people ""Free Will"".

- Mrmattmart, hard determinist"
I'm not reading the comments cause they are too long.
Now what about insane people? What does grind their gears?
"Ideas about illusions can go very far. You can easily believe that your whole life is a dream or matrix or whatever... But even if so, idea about not having a choice at all is kinda complicated. People tend to change their evaluations and decisions, especially after traumatic events. You tend to comfort yourself saying that its better than it actually is. So if you chose to neglect the facts, comforting yourself and changing the original perception of events can it be still predetermined in DNA?"
"that's a relative statement... However I will say that you choose to react the way you want to react. If we live a predetermined life, then what's the point of living? unless of course you don't believe in a meaning to life. Then in that case, I will say, that did you choose to get up out of bed this morning? Did you choose the eat your food? If I had no free will or purpose to life, i'd rather die. But then again, dying would just lead you to an eternal void if there was no meaning to life..."
"It depends on the ratio of the density of the universe to the critical density. If the density were ever higher than than the critical density then our universe would recollapse into what's called a ""Big Crunch"". However, with our most current data suggesting that the density is, at most, equal to the critical density, the universe will expand forever."
"@Jest Imagine a day that we purposely make different decisions.  We yell at our boss, we get up to go to work but instead go to another Country.  We jump off a cliff just to show we have a choice.  If we follow the theory of your statement, it may still hold true because we made these decisions based on the stimuli of being told not to make these decisions, and thusly are still just doing what was expected to happen assuming our genetic makeup is that of rebellion in response to this discussion."
you just made my brain turn into water
Exactly
"Free Will by Sam Harris. Great book and author
"
"For those of you confused let us try an exercise, think of any animal at all. Now many thoughts likely populated as you read that such as dog, cat, lion, bear etc. Now what if I asked you: “Did you think of a squirrel?” It is likely you did not, but it is also likely that you have the idea of a squirrel stored in your memory. So why did your brain not provide you with that answer? We don’t understand why certain thoughts originate and others do not and where is the free will in that?"

"But the fundamental difference between the free will we speak of in Western societies and complete free will over our lives is that other humans have no say on what we do or not. Even if the situation you described is true, when humans hold direct power over other humans' actions, there are even more constraints and restrictions. This means that instead of many individuals coming up with their own ideas, there is only one or a few individuals which hold complete sway over our daily lives."
"one time i tazed a dead squirel, and it started kicking."
"We didn't always believe in free will, and many still don't. To quote Christopher Hitchens, ""I think we have free will because we have no other choice."" Even if you posit that we have no free will, you are choosing that position freely."
This comment reminds me of Brave New World and 1984....
"But what happens if there is a way to figure out what is going to happen? And once we know what is supposed to happen, we decide to do something else? Can't we do that? Also, does it mean that you were ""programmed"" to point out that this theory exists? Would this in turn, humanity discovering how our future works, actually was programmed? It seems like a paradox to me."
"Even if we are our brains (I would argue we are less than our brains - we are only the conscious witnesses of experiences), we are not responsible for the microstructures of our brains, which provide the platform upon which our thinking and acting depend. Our brains (and the wiring of them) are the result of our genes and the environment (all the influences over the the courses of our lives that shaped our worldviews). Decisions/actions that we make use hardware we didn't author. No free will."

A person can still fart after death - FARTING IS A NO-BRAINER.
"The real question is that even with a brain do we really make decisions or is it all an illusion? The Universe works on a cause and effect basis, so does free will exist? We may believe we are making decisions but that may be pre-determined based upon our genetic makeup, which we had no say in. We also have no control over the external stimuli we are exposed to...perhaps we are all cogs in the grand machine or meat robots moving along only believing in free will because we are programed thatway "

Well I guess the answer to your question would be no since you need your brain to make the chemical and to..well.... sleep."

that's true im studying the reflexes and this is good information

If you are decapitated do you lose your head? who is your head losing its body?

"aren't there cases where corpses actually sit up.? sometimes a good while after death..?
also disagree with the you are your brain thing.. there is no 'evidance ' to show that thoughts or intentions reside in the brain. Rupert Sheldrakes ideas of consciousness as a non-local field make much more sense to me adn are in many ways better backed and explain lots of the things that traditional model draws a blank on.. in which case you could say there are plenty of no brainers.."
a no-brainer is possible as during decapitations there is still enough air and energy for the brain to work just for a few seconds so you could blink and move your lips and even maybe the decapitated person might of saw his own body fall to the ground

love your charisma!

Where are you getting this from? They would show the head in order to demonstrate to the onlookers that the victim was indeed dead.
"In the times where punishment of some actions were to have your head severed by a guillotine, they would grab your head by the hair and show it to the audience. The reason they did this, is that your brain can actually function, see things, and be almost completely aware of its surrondings for 8 seconds. Creepy right?"
"Lol what are you thinking the serial killer will put salt on your lifeless body and make you dance?

this is my fav. vsauce episode to date :D

That's like saying bacon > cancer.
different purposes. but i see your point
"When a person gets decapitated your body pretty much dies, because you're headless; but, your head and brain don't. The brain doesn't fully shut down, until about aprox. 10 seconds. A decapitated head can hear for a few short seconds."
"2:32 - Vsauce: 20 mph
       - Caption: 30 mph"
"So if we humans had longer necks, thus having a long brain stem, and cut it at chin level we would be like Mike the head less chicken."
Sorry im just sitting in front of a computer with drool spilling out of my mouth.. BLARGGUGUGUUUURR - this comment was typed by rolling my head back and fourth in a unconscious spasm and makes sense by coincidence.
Wow
Is it posible for a person (his head) to live without the body?
Wow to the amount that youtube users suck the dicks of the channel owners is really disgusting. 
blown*
"not really. I think he is saying our brain is like the puppet-master, while the body is the puppet. Everything the puppet does is controlled by the master. If the master isn't present, the puppet can't do anything by itself. Our bodies are ours until we die, because at that point we have no control over it."
Making a YouTube Poop is definitely a no-brainer.
"Subscribing to VSauce is a no-brainer, but watching the videos definitely requires some form of intelligence."
I love Vsauce so much.
Vsauce > Everything on youtube
Mike the Headless Chicken <3
comparing intelligence with stupidity?? wow.
"So he's basically saying that we don't own our bodies, we are simply ""borrowing them"" temperarily....scary logic"
So Vsauce How do you explain Justin Beiber? all people need brains right? well how can he sing the shit?

therefore VSauce is greater then Smosh. "

"You use all of your brain, but not all at once.
Common misconception. "
"no, that's complete bullshit"
it's not true... and it's not even a theory just some stupid myth
I remember once we were on a school trip and a kid accidentally chopper of a lizards tail and it just wiggled around
No. Go watch mythbusters :D
"I'm fairly sure that the 'whole theory on using 10% of your brain' thing was the scientologists so you can bet it's either wrong or just misinterpreted. I believe that when scientists suggest you only use 10% of your brain, they are referring to the amount of your brain that you are conscious of. the rest of your brain is used in life support and the less apparent forms of instinctual consciousness. Thats my understanding anyway - I'm probably wrong."
"No, we use our whole brain, its just that not at the same time, some parts are activated while doing different things than others."
"Why no mention of anencephaly? The headless chicken alluded to it, but I think the fact that humans have lived 2 or 3 years without a brain (other than the brainstem) is definitely worth a  mention!"
"i did not need to see the frog legs thing
"
"Hey Vsause,
Since you obviously do lots of really good research for these videos, do you think you could make a video on good research techniques?  Thanks!"
"nop, Mythbuster busted that. we usually use around 33% to 35% of our brain in all time. 

that number can change but the average % is similar to what i said. "
i know this video is based on science but i have to point out it is possible to live without a brain. there was a story i heard on youtube some time ago about a little boy was born with only a brain stem and lived to be two years old. so what does that mean?
Nope. Wikipedia[.org]/wiki/Ten_percent_of_brain_myth
"It's not true.

lmgtfy com/?q=10%25+of+our+brain+myth"
"i'll tell you myself that it isn't true. if you cut out 90% of your brain that just.. wouldn't be any good. we might not know what some parts do, but every part's important."
"Actually, the problem is the counciousn and unconcouncios thought. Uncounciously, we use 100% of our brains (or close to that if you're a healthy person that eats her vegetables), but counciously our brain is very limited, that's what they must mean when they say we only use 10% of our brains. 

Counciously we can process only 5 to 9 bits of information simultaneously (we can put atention to an average of 7 things at a time). However, uncounciosly we can process 10,000 bits of information."
"this is the one of the most interesting, but disgusting Vsauce videos I've seen :("
:(
almost threw up at the frog legs!
"If you use more if it, then your brain will be overworked :/"
I think he or someone else answered before. It is a complete lie. You can use the full capacity of your brain or at least you have the ability to. Hopefully someone can explain it much better than me but there is an answer! ^^
"In a sense I do believe our brain is more capable than most people think. During REM sleep our brain activity is increased. Dreams during this stage often seem longer than they actually are because we are processing at quicker rates. Also in life or death situations the fight or flight response may be triggered which causes adrenaline to be released. People have been able to lift cars, run at abnormal speeds and even survive high falls. "
Long live vsauce
"no we use all of our brain. it is true, however, about 10% of our brain are neural networks. soe the other 90% is glial cells, which just kind of help with the whole processing. hope this helps!
"
"mythbusters actually did an episode about this, they proved its not true"
"me too, they give me a heart attack when i see one."
"I thought he already did an episode about it ? well since your asking, the answer is that your brain does use about ""10%"" but if you where to use more your brain would overload and you would probably have seizures and eventually die. Our brains are not meant to be running full capacity all the time because that would be very inefficient. Certain parts of the brain are only used when they are needed. Someone improve my answer if im am wrong =D "
Vsauce = the last smart people in USA
"@EvanH2000. because when there is no light, there is no color, therefor there's black. like when you go to bed and you turn the lights off. your room turns black, since there's no light hitting it"
"No, it's not true. If you only used 10% of your brain, that's essentially coma status. Not sure what the real average number is but its far more than 10% at any given moment, unless of course... you're writing this from a coma state."
i love this channel so much.. I wish I could subscribe twice.
"This was a pretty interesting vid, like all your rest but just a bit freaky this time. I almost thought this video would bring up a story I heard some time ago about a kid being born without a brain and living for like... I think they said like over a year and 'still living to this day' whenever the video was made. I wish I remembered where I seen it though..."
"today in my anatomy class, we discussed muscle and nerves and a real no brainer is the ones muscles or nerves that are involuntary muscles and nevers because it does not need the brain to think about moving or feel"
You're just jealous! :p
"It's not like the other 90% is left unused, it's just that
we use only 10% for ""higher"" functions, like thinking,
math etc.. The other 90% deals with ""lower"" functions,
like regulating hormones, automated breathing etc.."
Because there is (almost) no matter for the light to diffract.
"There are companies that do that you know, with
the hope that someday they'll be able to unfreeze
them & transplant them or something."
There's a minutephysics on that.
well... im officially not getting cremated. 
"Yeahh,I would like to find out about the same topic from Michael"
"What if you kept the person's brain and froze it ...then technically the person that died would still be alive...

What?"
Question: That whole theory on using only 10% of your brain is it true? How so?
"That depends on if he means it or not. If he lies about it then his nose grows, if he speaks truthfully of it then it wont. The words dont matter, just the way he means them. (In my opinion)"
well he would be lieing so it would grow wait that means hes telling the truth so it wont grow which makes him a lier ... my head hurts
"hi
"
"No, it's real. There are videos and articles (including wikipedia) about it."
the chicken one is a fraud.
Your brains in you take your brain can live for years in another body. When you die if you you brain still lives for about a day till it starts to rot away
"i was gonna answer that, but i don't think the answer to that fit's in a youtube comment so let's just hope michael sees this"
his geniuses is making me genius. Id love to meet this guy c:
"Those frog legs freaked me out, my cheenis nearly screamed."
Maybe it will grow in its imaginary part (complex numbers). Then his nose grew without growing. 
"Or said ""I'm lying""?"
"Hold your horses! I have a very (unrelated) important question! How can we do to remain in the exact same spot?, I remain in certain position in the planet, but the planet moves, and even if the planet stood still, the galaxy is moving. So again, Is there something in the universe not moving?"
"It would grow. I know you wanted to shine with a paradox but check this out. Pinocchio says that his nose will grow, since it's a lie as he can't control it his nose will grow and only after it has grown the statement that his nose will grow will be true. "
"His nose only grows when he lies. But when his nose grows, he didn't lie. So his nose doesn't grow, but then he lied, so his nose grows...........................etc."
"wow..i just learned something on youtube

Vsauce do a video on y we enjoy certain things like music when its a language we dont understand
It'd grow
It will grow one second later
"Do a part on Quantum computers! I am very interested to know how a quantum processor would work, and what performance it would have. I am REALLY interested in this, and I think other people will be too"
"Our sun can not become a black hole. Correct me if i'm wrong, but the sun is not and can not become large enough. However, our sun will continue to grow for some billion years and will eventually ""swallow"" Mercurius, Venus and even earth and might even Mars but that is by far not large (masive) enough to collapse into a blackhole. The sun will probably become a white or brown dwarf but that is a story on his own ;) Hope this explaines a bit! I'm 18 years old, and definatly not a physics major :P"
Propably nothing significant would happen because there's a difference between lying and being wrong.

"The egg came first! An egg is essentially an amniotic sac which down the evolutionary path, came before chickens evolved! "
"It would be the egg, because the mutations for the chicken, don't happen unless the animal is being developed with it, which is in the egg."
"In your sentence, the egg. Boom."
if you go on the creation story side of things the chicken. 2 to be exact. Go with big bang and you have no answer. So my conclusion is the chicken.
"I started laughing when he said yes brainer XD

Nothing would ever touch eachother after the original creation point(bigbang/godmade)
"What about a video on why are things gross or better yet why do people think things are gross. Like dogs, cats and many animals will eat anything but why are pick with what they eat"
There would be no earth or anything. All the planets and stars would break apart and matter would spread itself uniformly throughout the universe.
You should make an episode about the reality of things.
hey vsauce!! i know it's stupid but.. if a giant couple have a child.. as the time goes.. would this child be giant too?? because of gravity..
"I may not be Vsauce but I can give u a good explanation. Assuming evolution is real, the animal that preceded the chicken must've laid an egg which then became the chicken. So it is the egg that came first."
This guy is smart and he really does his research.!:)
I love vsauce .... like so much you just don't understand lol ... omg I think I'm having a yes-brainer
The egg. before the egg came ....another species.

"Nope.  From a discovery article youtube won't let me link.
A fully developed hurricane releases 50 or more terawatts of heat energy at any given moment, only about 1 percent of which is converted into wind. The heat release ""is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes.""  The entire human race in 2011 used about a third of the energy present in an average hurricane. So bombing a hurricane might be about as effective as trying to stop a speeding Buick with a feather."

Dammit Vsauce stop making me rethink my whole life!
well if you are young enough doctors can actually cut out one of the hemispheres of the brain and due to developmental plasticity the remaining half can adapt to fulfill the roles of the missing half... so what i think is interesting is whether this means you could theoretically remove half of a small child's brain and put it in another body and them develope two independent consciousnesses from the same brain. 
vsause is a tad bit off at the end... the majority of the time. its your unconscious brain performing tasks before your conscious brain even realizes it. so we technically dont do things consciously.. our brain does it for us automatically but we have an illusion of conscious will that makes it seem like the thought or event matches our expectations
half of the other brain does the same work. still requires a brain :p

"Hey Michael, what causes a headache? What goes on in my body, that causes my head to ache?"
there is no satisfactory reaction to prevent being burned. hot oil falls on your skin or you touch hot oil the reaction isn't fast enough to prevent the burn. finally we can consciously choose to allow ourselves to be burned.
fire is the light and heat emitted by some chemical reaction it's form has to do with the interaction of the reagent and products with the atmosphere . mind and self are harder to discribe
"Can you explain hiccups Michael?

Its a chemical reaction with oxygen heat and fuel so its a light

Michael is best than my anatomy prof
no Vsauce explained why you are wrong in another video
Em no C the speed of light varies in the conditions it's in for example if it was in water it would be significantly slower than if it moved in air but the speed C used in for example E=mc2 C is the lights speed in a vacum :)
Can you do a video on comfortability? If that's even a word. Lol
Depends on your intelligence. 
light moves the same speed in every refrence frame. so the light would go normaly
*snaps finger*
"Time would slow down inside the train to the point where you cannot accelerate any further. Whenever something approaches light speed, time, and not the speed, is what is able to change in order to maintain this cosmic speed limit."
you're brain can hold up to 4 terabytes.
it's more than a terrabyte
nice g-shock!
"You shouldn't be able to, because due to mass dilation, which would be infinite, and F=ma, you shouldn't be able to move. But length would also contract, and the front of the train would take up the same space as you before you started walking, so in a sense, you already got there."
"Apparently space gets compacted so you can still walk to the end of the train, watch 1veritasium to find out more"
That's where special relativity comes in. It states that light maintains a constant velocity in all reference frames. 
"I no longer am me because if I'm my brain, you just blew it"
"if the headlights are turned on while theyare moving at the speed of light then wouldnt the photons be travelling at speed of light times 2?
"
"To the first part of your answer: Yeah, but what then? If we turn on the light bulb, but the light can't leave the bulb, what happens? We keep on creating new light, but the photons can't go away. So what happens? Is our car going to explode due to an overload of photons?"
Any one??!!        @ 2:04 he spits 
And thats if you can get the car up to the speed of light in the first place :L
"4000 :)
approx"
"Studies have shown that our brains can hold between 10 and 100 TB (10 000 GB, 100 000 GB)."
""" keep in mind with our heads intact ---""

pun intended?"
". You might have only a few gigabytes of storage space, similar to the space in an iPod or a USB flash drive. Yet neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brain’s memory storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes).

Straight from a scientific website, it's our best estimate but no one knows for sure. (Like all scientific theories)"
Michael! Do a video on fun! Why are things fun to us? Why do we play video games?
Now my brain hates me!
"several terabits of short term memory , with long term varying "
"no, so far, no one has been able to find a limit on brain capacity."

THAT IS A GREAT ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!
"ok, here is a question, so, we aren't able to move faster than light, i kind of get that, but what about a black hole? the gravity from one is great enough to stop light from escaping, does that mean that the gravity from the black hole greater than the speed of light? and does that mean if something entered a black hole it would move faster than light?"
I think Its about  2.5 petabytes 
"Here's something, twin sisters are on earth one goes onto a rocket ship capable of reaching the speed of light she goes to a distant planet (20 years away) and comes back to her it feels like 20 minutes there and 20 back but to her sister she has been gone for forty years in her perspective she and herself has aged forty years but the girl on the rocket sees herself aged only 40 minutes"

"It goes to Hell after its done. . . .Kidding

Sound is just the movement of air molecules. As the molecules are displaced like an accordion or slinky they begin to lose velocity due to resistence and the sound fades away. The reason there is no sound in space is because there are no molecules for the disruption of movement (talking or swinging a stick fast) to move the surrounding air molecules. Its crazy to think all we hear is air molecules moving in a pattern.  "
"you would be at the speed of light so it would move with you. Now, moving faster than the speed of light and putting on the headlights......no idea"

"A beam of light would speed away from the head lights at the speed of light. That simple. It's a constant. Means it don't change. No matter the context. :3
But I'm probably wrong, kuz I am a noob. 
You'd better understand it that the car would be in its own private universe the moment it reached c. So you would still see the light propagate at c."
It would be pointless to have them on since you won't see anything at all. The light would be at the same speed so it would never display in front of you. This is ignoring of course the problem that if you did go at speed of light you and your car would be demolished and burned by friction well before reaching the speed of light.
Please do a video on anti-gravity or sumthing like that ehh

"At the start, traveling at the speed of light will be impossible in our dimension or space due to our mass restriction. Well lets say we are anyway. In perspective of person in the car, nothing really changes. Light does whatever it wants to and travel forward as it normally do. In perspective of the observer, The light would not be visible to them, Well in fact they will be like frozen in time. Well if you can still see them due to length dilation."

"True, such a person may not be thinking about the concept of right and wrong, since they are without culture and aren't able to be influenced by others' ideas. But this doesn't mean that they are unable to think (wordlessly) about who they are, where they came from, what is their meaning, etc. They would still have the sense of touch and be able to understand there are other living things interacting with them, they might wonder who these people are, and love is something we feel, not are taught"

"i do have to mention this, supposedly a long time ago (i couldn't tell you when) one of the Christian saints was beheaded for some of the ""foolish"" things he said. just after he was beheaded he stood up, grabbed his head, and walked down the street, like nothing happened; till a few minutes later, he died. of course i don't know if this story is true, i dont even remember the guy's name, but its still interesting. and it seems like you did do enough research."
"Hi Michael, 

you should do a video on lifeforms/animals/plants surviving/living in unlikely environments. that would be interesting!"
Then you couldn't cover up the whole screen. Circles can't make tessellations. Try covering up an entire table using pennies without laying any pennies on top of others.
"You can't travel at the speed of light, but for your question let's say you were 99% of it.
Your headlights would be traveling at the speed of light, relative to a stationary observer. Common sense tells you that relative to you the light only travels 1% its normal speed, but relativistic speed addition works differently. Accounting for time dilation and length contraction, the headlights would be traveling at the speed of light relative to you."
This is a good idea. I would like to know this.

How could you think about time or the endlessness of space if you didn't even know what they were? Or even just a basic thing such as deciding if an action is good or bad is impossible for someone who hasn't been taught by their surroundings to think the way others do (aka 'didn't learn culture').

But that force isn't going to the ball. Two different forces make a skateboard roll and a ball go through the air. So your saying all the tests where the ball just dropped are wrong?

Exactly. The forward motion of a skateboard is also force (otherwise it wouldn't be moving). When you throw the ball you add the force of the throw to the force of the skateboard moving forward.
"... they dream through an extremely vivid sense of touch. (we would never be able to imagine that because we have our senses, but to the blind and deaf, and in some cases both, percieve that as a normality and is no different to them than your dreams where you can see and hear. I hope that answers your questions. :)"
"I can answer your question, when a person is born deaf, or blind, or both, they think (and dream) using the other senses. When you ask 'how do they talk in their heads', you are talking about thinking using the sense of hearing. Blind people think and dream in sounds (mostly) and deaf people dream and think in vivid shapes and scenes. It simply refocuses your brain power to the other sense. As far as being born blind and deaf, I couldn't tell you, but my best guess would be that... continued"
"The original question did say they were blind as well though. I don't think their mind could develop very well or contain any basis for developing abstract ideas. With no visual information ever coming in or at least having concepts be explained to them through language, their frame of reference of the world would be severely limited if no mostly non-existent. We do have inherent communication capabilities without language, but we need to know of other entities existing to communicate with them."
Doing something over and over in hopes to get a different result.
I wonder why Mike the head-less chicken was alive...
I want Vsauce to become my teacher c:
"You probably know more about this then me, but wouldn't our genetic capabilities for symbolic communication give us the ability to think abstractly? Language is a byproduct of social agreement and the way we think. So having a shared language is a means by which we understand abstract data but not the understanding itself. I don't think it's a logical leap to say that an otherwise functioning human who was deaf and blind would lack abstract thinking merely because they didn't learn a language. "
What is insanity?
"What you think are matching colors is simply the ones you see together often or the ones your environment has taught you are matching. 
Why I think we see the same colors is because they all have a given wavelength, because our eyes are receptive to the same wavelength interval and because they get transmitted similarly to be processed in the same parts of our brain .  I think slight brightness variations might happen simply because some people's eyes are better at reacting to photons."
"Well, they definitely don't talk because they don't know a language and have no idea what talking or a voice is. I would think they do think, but because of the lack of a language and the 'system of thinking' it gives, their thoughts are much more basic and they're mainly about their needs to survive like the ones animals have. (For example how you would think about anything abstract without knowing a language that describes it? You couldn't.)"
"I have already wonder about that for years, and although I'm still not sure about the answer, what made me believe that the colors are the same (even though they may vary in brightness) is that the same colors match for everyone. For example, black and white match with all the other colors. They are neutral. I don't think if my black was your purple you would think black would be that ""matching"". Or for example brown, orange and blue doens't match to everyone. That shows something, huh? :)"

"The light and object absorbs and the light it reflects does not change. But you do experience things through your own nervous system, which makes the way you see light fairly unique. Also, culture and language tells you what this colour IS. If we all agreed green is now pink, it becomes pink. You can't 'imagine' a new colour straightforward, because you haven't been exposed to something other than what a prism can show you. Maybe other species see so much more reflected light, we don't know well"
hey i have a question which is better Vsauce or Vsauce2 ?
"Healthy people still use conceptual ideas to make sense of the world. Deaf and blind doesn't mean they are completely detached from the world. The main means of interpreting the world would be touch and odour, and there are languages using only touch as a medium, so it will be very different, but perhaps not too difficult to interpret, if you could enter their head for a day. :) Vsauce is awesome, btw.

no its impossible to imagine a whole new color because the colors we see are the only wavelength we can see we cant see gamma rays or radio waves or ultraviolet waves only waves with in the visable spectrum so basically what you see is what you get

"no it wouldn't. They have tested this plenty of times, but instead of on a skate board on a truck. Each time they dropped it went straight down. You can even test this yourself. The ball needs force behind it to keep on going, and just dropping it at speed doesn't give it the necessary force to keep going. Also your car analogy is all wrong. When you drive a car and then slam on the brakes it makes G-force in the forward direction.  "
I think he already answeed that... 
"Well, you have to consider what colour actually is. Light is a wave and what you or I percieve as colour is just a particular wavelength which our eye has filtered out, then the brain has decided what it will look like. Colour is entirely relative to how your brain processes it. I myself am colourblind, so the way I see things will look different to someone who is not. As the defect is in the eye, the way my brain processes the colour will be different. That's what I believe anyway."

Wait! How do we know whether 'you' or 'me' ie our being/personality is even in our brain or is it our soul as god has created us while our body is just a medium for our soul to live in this world??
"Sure it COULD be like that, but it probably wouldn't make very much sense if it were like that. Since evolution has made it so that everything else on humans are so alike, we all have two arms, two legs, a head etc, why would we see different colors differently? It would probably take some serious serious idiotically advanced changes to chance someone's brain into seeing colors differently, and I don't think humans differ THAT much from each other."

yes yes yes!!!!! have always thought of this question!!
"This question has already be answered. We all have rods and cones in our eyes. It helps us to determine colour. A loss of one rod and cones can change the way we interpret colour. A study showed that colour blind people have a vast difference in rods and cones compared to normal seeing people. Another study showed that everybody has a different number of rods and cones in our eyes. As we all have different number of rods and cones, we will all see and interpret colour differently."

"My theory: Both of us know what the color brown is, and what the color pink is. The colors have different wave lengths, so if I see brown and you see pink, I believe we do see the same color. But the wave length does not represent either pink or brown, it is something in between. A color (or tint) that we do not have a name for. That is where our brain decides what the color actually look most alike, and our brains do not see it the same way."

From there, I don't see how it is possible for someone's brain to swap the colors and from there spread in another direction. There are rod cells in the retina responsible for perceiving light, and some rods have been found to react to different wavelengths, these rods are close to identical in all human."

Our cells are highly specialized and they require the highly-regulated internal environment of our bodies to live - a little too hot/cold/acidic/basic/pressurized/depressurized, and they'll die pretty fast. I still think they count as being alive (since they metabolize nutrients for energy, expel wastes, and reproduce), but you probably couldn't count them as being their own organisms. Just a thought."

"Vsauce, I have a question. If poop is material with the nutrients removed from it, why does it make good fertilizer?"
Nope. If you have a ball already going at 20 mph and drop it it's horizontal speed would stay the same. It's horizontal velocity doesn't stop just because it's no longer is attached to what was moving it. Example; when you're in a car and you suddenly brake the car stops but you keep going until the seat belt stops you or you hit something. Just because the car immediately stops didn't mean you did. And you're applying Newton's law incorrectly.

Also c always moves at c, it's wavelength and momentum may change...but it's still always c...

"Interresting. Especially when you consider that our brain is made up of individual living cells. I mean, does the ""mind"" only reside in our brains, or are we each a collective consciousness formed by every cell in the body? Look at the experiment scientists did with tapeworms and a maze. Only a couple made it through the first time, but when they cut them up and fed them to 100 other tapeworms, all 100 completed the maze just as the ones they'd eaten had. Somehow, they absorbed the knowlage. O.O"

"Hi Nicki,

The simplest answer is that the light particles will travel at a constant velocity, they will neither speed up or slow down (assuming a vacuum), light is effected in a different way. Light will 'follow' the 'distortion' in the space/time fabric. In fact get gravitational lensing. An object with mass will pass the planet, be attracted by gravity, and slingshot in a different direction. Light 'bends' towards the planet, then 'bends' back. See gravitational lensing on wiki."

"If light is faster than itself at some points, then maybe you COULD actually be able to travel at the speed of light...?"
"I've seen an article about a french scientist who cuts the heads of some prisoners and finds out that their eye pupils still react seconds after their heads were decapitated, they still had brain activity, so basically when a head is decapitated it still senses the outside world for seconds or maybe even a couple of minutes. I wish there were a deeper investigation in that area."

living is the same as alive and nonliving is the same as dead so yeah i guess i meant that.

Something like drowning, burning to death, starving or dehydration is probably the worst pain... or, y'know, getting your guts ripped out while you're still concious (no idea how to spell that word haha)."
Why???
muito legal
This is my favorite video you have made yet! Science and philosophy amazing :D
You'll see later in the video. Just don't :D

Great show... Did'nt know the thing about hair and nails... But it sounds plausible.
this was the first vsauce my mind didnt blown cus i knew that stuff alrdy :/
Mike and his passion to be literally speaking all the time...
"5:00 Nails & Hair dont grow, skin shrinks.
He didn't say anything about the human head part that's true."
SON OF A--- all of the cool videos keep cutting out and not letting me watch the last few seconds at the end today -_-
"Hi Vsauce, love the show! Please do an episode on why humans seem to get taller as time goes on. I keep hearing that people were a lot shorter 100-500 years ago (and beyond) but not sure why. ---> lack of natural predators should indicate smaller size? Thanks! "
I like how you instagibbed my comment instead of being friendly and told me in a proper maner. All I thought was it looked funny/perculiar. 
Uumari1 there is actually a vsauce about why you are probably NOT the 305th viewer! Check it out.

I like that new song in 3 min. What is it? It sounds like the binding of issac

So that is what i call an no- brainer :D"
Dying is a no brainer
Deep man....REEEAAALLL DEEP!!
Toes this mean that if some ones body gets enough energy after dying it becomes a zombi ?
This is the most interesting page on youtube! Congratulations Vsauce!

Watch the video.
"Vsauce, just wondering if this is true(some say it is true and some say it's not).
If after you're death, does your nails and hair still grow?
And, is it true that a decapitated head(human) can still live a few seconds after it's off you're body?"
"wouldn't air or something vibrating your vocal cords a no-brainer, because things like air or steam could do so?"
"who else knew about vsauce 3 before he said it?

"
D: ... my skin isnt my skin @.@
and you still dont know the reason why the likes and views are correct.... derp -_-
The beginning concept was good but it got pointlessly deep into the question for like the last couple minutes.
how many Vsauces are they gonna make?
damn creepy music
i guess you could call it a ... *puts on glasses* real no brainer!! OOOH YEAAAAAH!!
"I don't know that I want to identify ""me"" with ""my brain."" The primary problem with such an exact linking of identity to one specific body part is degenerative brain disorders, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. When they are in their advanced stages do we simply say that the person no longer exists? It seems like identity involves more than just a singular body part (the brain), but may include things like personal history and other aspects as well."
I wonder what would you see if you are in a total darkness.
"So, a chicken with no head would still cross the road?"
69 hehe
I Think the brain has a leader of you body. And you ar the brain.
Because they are not interchangeable words?
Well i have left school now but i said i would of loved it when i was at school. to have this much knowledge explained to me in 10 mins like Michael does would of been amazing.
You are amazing.
Neat!
Its called science
i bet michael watches TBBT
His voice is comforting
"Dieing is a no-brainer.
"
"Awesome, although I would never have wanted to see that chicken with no head, disturbs me to think about it. The way I see ""you"" is basically being aware of your surroundings and being able to feel things and think for yourself. I would say make decisions too, but you could be in a coma, or a vegetable and still be able to be aware, think and feel, just not move or show much signs that your able to do those things."
Mine hasn't recharged yet. 
well you are right i thinkt about it before i posted the mesage but that is the difrense bettwen talk and chat. but when i think about it didn't rellt think about the thing i'm saying right now it's like a difrent brain that talk for me and say if im hungry or not. and my brain chosse if i will say it or not. in fact if i didn't like what i texted right now i properbly deleted it... maybe im more like a oh brainer
My best friend has had no head for four years! But he has been dead for four years...
There was a child that was born without a brain. He lived over two years without one.

I feel so saucey now...
You must new here.
Isn't it true that once your head has been... removed... from your body basic reactions will still occur i.e. when the persons name is said their eye's will open or react in some form or another...

"Despite their evolutionary history and relative separation, mitochondria are, as far as I'm aware, made from my DNA code. The bacteria in my gut may live in close symbiosis, but they could theoretically be easily replaced with a different strain of bacteria doing the same job.

That was freakin cool
"This is moderately, but only moderately, disturbing"
this is the most scary vsauce video i hv ever seen............
you stay alive for 10 seconds after your head is cut off.
someone seems a bit angry for no reason. might want to get that looked at
and that is how zombies survive :O
"how does that mean i have no brain?
Robert just deal with it, its a no-brainer
fuck off"
"The ego is an illusion. Life and death do not exist, there's just matter in the world changing forms and we immerse ourselves so deeply in thought that we see ourselves as real. But we're just playing a game."
So cut my head off and my body is no longer me. But what about my head? Does it keep going even for a little while? Does the brain register that my body has gone?
"there was once a guy who kills people with a guillotine. he made an experiment with one of the people who was going to die. he said: ""after i have cut your head, if you blink as many times as you can, you will go to heaven"" and the guy said ok. i don't remember what happened then. could it be possible to blink after your head is cut off?"
Watching these videos while tired is a bad idea!
"I have an idea for the next vsauce video, discuss whether or not viruses are living!:)"
"Как можно по-русски заголовок перевести, чтобы он не потерял смысла?"
I knew what it meant. Hello 9Gag!
It gets reflected through prisms and spheres like raindrops. Like that famous guy who discovered that light is made up of separate colour. Isaac newton? He discovered that light is reflected as it passes through things.
@Vsauce Next time can you not put something on the green screen? It looks much better with something on the green screen.
I used to watch my dad cut the heads of his freshly caught fish and then lightly salt the flesh and I was amazed as the headless fish kept flipping its tails. Even though I new the salt and the nerves caused a reaction it made me think.
You joking?
"And the mitochondria (archae bacteria) within each of your skin cells? With their own plasma membrane, own circular plasmid of DNA, own replication mechanisms and unique biochemistry?  The bacteria in your gut are just as much 'you' as the mitochondria in your skin.  And what of all the atoms of which your skin is comprised that originated externally and are not part of 'your' DNA?  Is that also part of 'you'?  If yes a part of 'you' could be floating in my water right now. *gulp*              "
"Oh, buddy... Your cells include mitochondria which were bacteria many years ago that now enjoy jolly symbiosis with you. They grab oxygen collected by breathing, combine it with chemicals from your food and make adenosine triphosphate which is a molecule ironically mentioned in the video. Furthermore, you would not be able to survive without the bacteriological climate present on your skin. Still further, you need air to breathe and live so there's really no limit to what is and isn't ""you""."
:D same to you.. lol
What percentage of your weight as reported by a scale is actually composed by things other than the cells with your DNA (discounting dead stuff your cells make like hair and nails) ?
I think I picked the wrong V Sauce video to watch while eating. :(
pls become my teacher on everything.
Aren't jellyfishes no-brainers?
Most likely due to makeup applied so he looks good on the camera.
"It's the same information, just like the number 5 is the number 5."
"A funny thing is that everything you are is in your Brain, But when you refer to yourself, You refer to everything that makes you up. I am me, Me referring to my entire body. "
@Saad Ardati the water molecules in the air bend causes the light to bend
Would it be fair to say cockroaches have a distributed or decentralized brain?
it's kinda like when you are slaughtering chickens. their muscles quiver for quite a minute after you cut their head off. it really weird when you start taking the skin off and their muscles are still twitching.
Sweeeeet vsause3!!!!!! Imma go there now!
What if someone cloned you then. Would that be classified as part of you?
"watch Baby born without brain brain turns 2, this kid was only born with a brain stem and has still lived for 2 years, the only thing is he has to take alot of medicine because of all of the complications of not having a brain"
Stewart's melville college says hi 
What does Vsause taste like?
"I love vsauce.
As always, awesome video."
"According to your definition, the bacteria in your gut are just as much 'you' as your neurons.  Also, what of the mitochondria (little archae bacteria) within each of your skin cells with their own plasma membrane, own circular plasmid, own replication mechanisms and unique biochemistry.  Fused through endosymbiosis, it has evolved with us for eons.  You are totally reliant on this relic bacteria for ATP, is this less a part of 'you' than the digestive bacteria in your gut?     "
Dat Chicken
i knew that he would show'em :D
"Q: what's the one thing that named itself?
A: the brain."
I love this channel
those unnatural facts scared my sht out
I love it when that smooth jazz kicks in and Michael goes all wide eyed mid sentence..... it means you're just about to get mind fucked.
You just blowed my mind
I think you mean watching vsauce. :P 
well if you think about it... the brain is the only organ that named itself
i was really hoping for an explanation of the Russian decapitated dog where the head of the dog lived on and they could feed it cheese for... i think it was about 4 hours or something like that... the head was rigged on a machine and it could response to light and sound... that is interesting :D
But that's what she said :D
Note To Self: Don't Eat While eating vsauce.....
"Damn I would love to just sit and have a conversation with you, most people deliberately don't think deep because they are lazy or they just assume the person they are talking to won't/can't but it really would be awesome to just talk about the world and stuff :D"
It Is Just For You
"I wonder if ""soul"" can be described as biological complex with physical form or neurochemical mechanism. And if it can, how is it ""works""?"
"lol, Vsauce has a Vneck"
"tecnically youre not yourself, so no =D"
Somebody give this guy a tv show.
"Those frogs legs made me cringe like hell; along with the idea my skin is still alive for days after i'm dead. Cool, but *shudders* oh dear god."
Dat haircut.
"Because their function is not depended on the function of the Brain therefore while you are dead these cells continue to ''do their job''. In other words while you are dead these cells arent, so its a part of ''you''?"
"hey what about him watch?v=WMlVNFpzKNI 
He has no brain but lives? Or you don't count it because he has brain stem... I think so."
this just made me scared of death
"Depends on how you define 'me'.  Your definition of 'me' as that which doesn't originate from an external source is meaningless as every atom in your body, including those which make up your brain, once existed outside of your body; the atoms that made up 'your' zygote are long gone.  Only genetics and environmental influences keep you  morphologically constant.  It's like drawing a picture in glue and throwing sand over it.  Are 'you' the glue, or the sand that people see?                     "
"what the numberphile video, why do youtube videos stop at 301."

"Michael, could you do an episode on the possible non-existence of the soul from a neurological point of view? "
damn really liked this one:D
Do the fourth dimension damnit! :D
No. thank you!
"Micheal, You should do something about different foods and their names... Fast food, healthy food, low fat... Etc..."
I sneezed right as he said sneeze.
Wow sc ha n original comment. It was never said on these videos.
I am energy. A spirit trapped in a prison and a physical form. 
go to nobrain.dk thats a nobrainer
Omg this is something I learned in school before vsauce thaught me O.o
THOSE FROG LEGS O.O

is it possible to train yourself to react in like in sport like with oven where signal doesn't need to reach brain  
Where's that perfect mirror room video we were promised? I like the possibilities of that...
What I wanna know is how do the foreign bacteria get inside your body? Are you born with them inside you?  or do they get inside you when you breathe your first breath and if that's the case how does the body react to that?
"nobrain.dk

;p"
Vsause V necks.
Im a zombie and I am offended by this.
"Vsauce I'm really interested in you doing a video on ""Is Telekinesis/Pyrokinesis/etc possible?"" That would really tell me how fake/real the videos I've been seeing really are, so please consider making a video on this? :D"
"Those are all great no-brainers, and I've got a really creepy one to add. The Lazarus sign is a motion made by brain-dead patients where they lift their arms and relax them across their chest, like an egyptian mummy. I won't post any links here (cos it's pretty damned disturbing) but it's safe to say it's a no-brainer!"
I do to!
Can you make a video on fear?
"Can some please get me a ""you"" count for this video"
"But even after your brain is dead, ur skin cells contains YOUR DNA, so it's still ""you"""
Why? So you go to school in the US?
I think simply the fact that they continue 'living' after a person has died. Although I do agree with your view.
1:16 Thanks for ruining my cereal. 
thanks for putting in the km or else i wouldnt know
"then something wrong with your school, may i know the address of your school good sir i may need to put it on the list."

WTF Did I just read?
*Boom* My mind was just blown
Oh! a new Vsauce. (Like and Favorite)... Then watch video
2:06 spit :P
I want a headless chicken!
The chicken kinda blew my mind
"Interesting, but i think the perception of ''you'' is a too difficult to explain. I think we are gonna be able to answer this, first, when we get to know, what is after the death."
I hate the youtube fucking app
I'm always left kind of mindblown after watching Vsauce videos.
welcome to youtube -.-
and?
"I don't think the bacteria are YOU, but I do believe that your skin cells are YOU. Mainly because the bacteria living in your gut do not contain your DNA, nor are they 'created' by you. They are completely seperate organisms from YOU, whilst your skin cells contain your DNA, they contain your entire bodily make-up, every detail about what cell goes where in YOU. Thus I would consider them, YOU. Never the less, this was again, a nice video and I enjoyed watching it. "
I need sleep. :'(
"Oh you're so right, friend"
"who is interested in more creepy and much more scientific things, /watch?v=lICXAFFxWgk"
this is actually caused by the system it uses numberphile has a video on it if you want more

then what are you?
"Naww, we don't want that! Vsauce's giving us free knowledge that can be watched across the globe! Discovery channel's too restrictive. I don't even have paid TV. Thank you Vsauce! Love your vids. "
Last time I watch Vsauce while eating dinner...
BS that will delete your pc and mess it up
What is the first song? (starting at 2:47) Can't find it on Jake Chudnow's channel..

"Hello Vsauce! You continue to amaze me with your videos. I would love if you could explain the wasp + salt experiment, either in a video or here as a comment.
If you dont know what it is i'll explain. My mother used to show me when i was little that if you can drown a wasp  for several hours (we tried 2hours 30 min of being completely under water). But if you then take it up, place it on a plate and cover it with salt it will magically come back alive and fly away. HOOW?!
Thanks!"

yeah me too!

How do you explain my channel?
i had to close my eyes through the cockroach part...
"Might be hard to believe, but it happened."
"A brain is also made up of cells, so if you are extremely philosophical, you can say you never live. The brain stem isn't voluntary, you don't have control over your heart beating. (saying that you can't stop it from beating, not that you can't make it beat faster or slower)"
wait what does that make a zombie

so does that mean that toaster dont toast toast,

reducing a person to brain activity? you can do better tan that! 
Nice topic...especially when you are eating :D
"Vsauce, you almost got into the free will issue. You should definitely do a video on free will."
"You should do a video about ""ATTRACTION"""

there are still people that watch TV???

I want this show on discovery channel !
These are some serious cartesian ideas. Deeeeeep

in my history book at school was a chapter about an french philosopher got his head cut off in guillotine and blink'd hes eyes without a body for some 20 times.
20mph? there was 30 written
XD
do some more philosophical stuff
Nah. Probably just pedos.
"Michael, I know you have a fair amount of viewers/subscribers but I don't think you get the credit you deserve, thank you man, your videos really interest me and I feel like I ACTUALLY learn something by the time the video has ended. 
You put an awful amount of effort into these videos and I just want to make sure you know people are grateful.

As always thank you for the videos and I need some more DONG!"

yes there are i hear them sometimes at night in the backyard

@Jkg58 But one thing I don't understand is that the Man'oWar jellyfish has 'eyes'. It has been shown that they can detect color and respond by moving away or closer to different colors? So how does that work?
Hi
did this things and more with frog legs at college. Creepy but fun
Poop will never be the same
That was a joke.
"Hey VSause... how fast is a thought? Can that even be tracked? Please help me out, you've answered every single one of the questions I've ever had except this one. Also. If its extremely fast, could it be affected by that law, where if things are traveling at a high speed, time slows. If so what exactly would your thought be after that?"
"Now this episode is creepyyy :S
"
There are no such things like zombies.
Penis at 4:27 :) 
Those frog legs.......
"Hey, VSauce, please do a video on the possibility of some humans being nocturnal, please?! :D"
so what about zombies? o_O
Did the vsause 3 guy get fired? I like the channel but the guy that hosted it wasn't as good as sir Michael and mr.bloop
Starfish and jellyfish have no brains which makes them a no-brainer.
Even Zombies need brains.
I beat this guy in a game of chess
Note to self; don't eat dinner while watching vsauce from now on
"Grabbed a piece of cake and sit to enyoy Vsauce.. And then, everything went to hell.. Decapitations, cockroaches, bacteria, headless chickens.. God damn! :)"
i can't believe i was eating while watching this T_T

well that was a no brainer
I watched this while i was pooping

A good idea to get suscriber :D
DUDE I HAVE THE SAME WATCH!
I don't really know why there are dislikes... because of the frog legs?

"i think of ""I"" as consciousness not the brain itself. so, i guess it could be said i am a concept and nothing physical. however, my existence does depend on the physical. to say,"" the brain"" implies one is the various processes of the brain such as memories, logic, and emotions, when in reality ""i"" is rather dehumanizing. it requires none of these things. that is my opinion anyways."
glad I watched this this morning rather than just before going to bed.
"If you moved your brain into a new body who is you,"

"Actually, it doesn't slow, it just stops and it doesn't only stop at 301, it can stop anywhere from 301-310 if not more. Mainly if people request the video at the same exact time, but anything after that will be halted till after YouTube's analytic team comes in and checks for fraudulent views. "

The dancing frog legs wete so gross D:

FROG LEGS DANCING CAN'T BE UNSEEN
I was thinking about reflexes before he mentioned them...now I feel like a genious
"Hi, brain is also perceiving time and out of time facts which called instantaneous moment. So if brain perceive out of time moment time is the concept that include being in time AND out of time. So muscles have their own brains . This brains are called concept or life app coming with the body that we receive at birth. I mean at conception when the soul clips with the spermatozoa and ovule."
"A piece of muscle walks into a bar, he asks how much for a pint.
The bartender says, for you. ATP."
"You've got the point, we don't need the whole brain to survive, we only need the brain stem that have the respiratory center, we only need oxygen to remain alive. People with brain death remain for years alive on mechanical ventilators. Give me oxygen and l'll survive :)"
"So I just got an idea for a scientific explanation for Zombies:

A foreign parasite burrows its way into the human skull. It then pumps bacteria into the human stomach. It feeds on human flesh (and for that matter, any living animal) to allow the bacteria to break it down and use the Sodium to power the muscles of the host zombie. "

ARE U TRICKIN' ME TO LEARN?!!?!
"I agree. Informative, yet trippy."

Another example is a 'computer' - you call the whole object (CPU, RAM, motherboard, etc.) a computer; but when you remove, say, the RAM, then it has a name of its own - a RAM."
I'm really curious what the soundtrack around 3:00 is. Does anyone know?
Make a Vsauce on zombies!!!

Hey vsauce!  comments here.
I just noticed that the brain is the only brain who has named it self...
du fuq the vid cut out at 7:17!
"I could write something like: ""like my comment if you snapped your fingers when michael snapped, lawl"" but I won't

wait a second ..."
You make a video once a month why the fuck would you need 3 channels?
becouse the blood is rushed down you body really fast.....
"From the brain, of course."
What about cyborgs? Ive your body is you when youre still allive are robot body parts also you? I mean they would be a part of your body and you could control them but they are not really you or am i wrong? Im confused :P
Is Vsauce2 your channel as well?
I love the music that is played after a question is asked...
"It happens when your sit for a long time and you get up quick I think it s orthostatic hypotension.... its normal,
sudden drop of BP when standing up."
I fucking jumped at that cockroach; why was I not told of that! *Pathetically smacks against his computer screen*
You must be new to YouTube...
"305 views 10,405 likes?"
"i dont even care about science but I watch vsauce, and listen to all the facts and figures AND remember them o_O"
"what a wonderful, joyful, not depressing, not horrifying subject matter! I was going to sleep, but who needs sleep! not me, oh no siree!"
k thanks for messing with me vsauce -.-
Ive always been curious the distance between rain drops. And how fast youd have to travel not to be hit by them
"Wouldn't it be an All-Brainer, or Only-Brainer?"
"the brain is the most important organ.....
but where do we get this information from? o.O"
Yes It happens to me too. like silverish dots moving around kinda slowly for some time. It happens to me most when I turn my head quickly. really wanna know what the hell they are O.o
You know the Vsauce music? that is when it's serious business thinky time.
"My dad used to work at a ranch, he had to cut a ducks head off, when he chopped it off the duck ran away, blood spewing, couple of months later it died and my dad ate it :)"
Try and go to nobrain.dk
i agree. descriptive facts from the man...
the worlds longest held breath is 8.5 min
Because you're blood get's affected by gravity and rushes away from your head causing you to feel light headed. 
it's because you have low bloodpressure. your musclepumps in your legs aren't active when you dont move. so when you stand up your brain doesn't get enough blood and then you feel fussy and if you're unlucky you could pass out. that's your bodys way of geting you down to ground level so it's easier to pump blood to your brain.
"A no brainier is adequately breathing and ur heart pumping blood.  ""Que no?"""
"This happens to me as well, do you wear glasses?"
"its blood pressure 
"
"Dammit Vsauce, my day was going quite well untill you gave me this damn existantial crisis!"
"One guy died like that, stood up after sitting for three days"
VAUCE! what would happen if an unstoppable force hit an immovable  object? Like so he can see!
why you no tell me sooner about vsauce3
you should totaly make a video about the higgs boson...
dude you really need to check your health lol....
man.. it's not even something too complicated to be explained by vsauce...maybe you should try asking can human escape from death and be immortal?
oh dear yes blood rushes out of your head then you dizzy brains says wtf you no give me blood !? 
Boner are no brainers
"As others have already explained, this is simply a head rush, no need to get alarmed or see a doctor about it, I have them too and I find that putting my head back down by doing a motion like stretching for my toes rushes the blood back into my head and all's nice and dandy."
"It's caused low blood pressure, but yes getting up slowly or stretching before you get up will help."
Starve to death :(
"Someone probably answered it already, but the blood pressure needs a few seconds to adjust to the higher one required for a standing position so your brain gets less blood than it needs in that time and you feel all that stuff."
"You probably have this answer already, but this is called postural hypotension. When standing, your blood goes to your legs because of gravity, so your heart pumps faster, and your blood cells constrict. when you sit or stand, though, your blood is more even in the body, and standing up has a bit of lag before that system can jump in place, and it leaves you with a sudden drop in blood pressure. If this happens often, wiggle your toes a bit before standing! It'll help get your blood flowing"
"""It will eventually... starve to death."" :)"
"Same here, I think it is caused by the rapid flow of blood when you stand up after ages. Pilots get it too. (but stronger) But I would like a good answer."
"They probably don't think in any particular language.  Language isn't needed to think in, it's just hard to imagine it any other way.  I would say they just think about their emotions or the actions they want to take, without putting it to words.  Of course they would probably also know whatever sign language they're used to, and most deaf people also know the normal language used where they are from (They do read after all.) and the basic mouth functions that go with speaking.    "
blood pressure
3 + 2 leansbacks
"Hey, check out me and my friends' channel, FatAndThinTV!"
"he does not think in a language, just like all the other animals, and babies do,
u dont always need a language to think, monkeys dont have a language but it has been proven that they are pretty smart, can can think, while learning a language may seem important in thinking, it is not really essential, the brain cells that allow us to have a language were developed in our brain before we HAD a language, but we still had tools which we made through thinking, i hope u get the concept"
You should see a doctor bro
"well u might be in a growth phase, when u get up fast u dont get enough blood. it will pass with time. if ur older than 25 however y may drink half a glass of red wine every day to replenish ur blood supply"
"Yeah, nowadays people don't know what mistakes are or what misreading is."
Are you fucking serious? 
"damn bro, that's deep."
Go to a doctor... seriously.
Maybe think with images?
Liking this video wasn't a no-brainer!
how far can i stretch
I'm guessing whatever language they write in?
"Micheal,
i need to ask you a question; why do some people enjoy dangerous activity like if they were watching a dangerous film like ""fast and furious"" i really want to know this Micheal and you may possibly be the only one to know this! "
gravity.
I'm not sure but it might be because you're growing and standing up to fast
"Because of you rapidly standing up, the blood from your brain goes down due to the G force that you have created. Not enough blood in the brain = you get dizzy, your eyes turn black and faint for a few seconds. It happens to me too :) Just don't stand up very quickly and you'll be fine:)"
Vsauce srsly needs to upload videos wayyy more often!!!
"same thing with me, when i stand up everything i see becomes fuzzy"
"Lol I happen to be learning about stuff like this in biology. We are studying cells,  and I was thinking that since prokaryotic cells are organisms,  and eukaryotic cells are sort of organisms,  we are made up of a bunch of tight cooperative organisms and molecules. Pretty weird."
and your head starts hurting slightly a little right? i have the same shit. i thinks its cause of my eyes since i watch too much youtube and play too much video games. maybe im wrong but i do know what your talking about same crap happens to me.
it did the exact same thing to me. refreshing the page seemed to have worked

I think you may have low blood pressure.
"I'm not the one that asked the question, lol, but still... Is it really your opinion that your thoughts consist of different combinations of 26 English letters? I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just curious if that is your stance. I've always felt like most thoughts are not in any language at all. Ideas, beliefs, etc, are created, and then our brain translates them into words."
Deep stuff.
"yep ... because you would have your own experiences. but there would be thousands of versions of you  all with independent thought . i suppose the real question is , if your having a 3sum with twins are you technically with two of the same person O.o?"

"No one really thinks in a 'language' spoken or signaled. For example, if you saw a cookie and thought it look yummy you would exactly think the english sentence ""I think that cookie is yummy"" you'd just think it's yummy. I don't know. I might be wrong. That's just what I think."
"blasphemer!

no, just kidding, I loved this video"
"even if there was a thousand me, there would still only be one me ;)"
"this is profoundly intriguing, and i often think about it. i think this goes into uncharted territory that nobody really has a solid answer.  but who knows if at the moment of birth we all receive the same consciousness' expect we're all individually shaped by our unique experiences, or if it there really is different consciousness to every single body. its mind boggling, and sense consciousness can't be physically measured theres no way to even going about figuring it out."
"Jesus christ my video stopped buffering at 7:17 and then it just stopped there like if the video was over, with the suggestions and relative videos and that stuff"
VSAUCE!!! i want you to answer this question. why sometimes when i stand up. a few seconds later my eyes turn everything black. sometimes i cant even stand straight and keep my balance and i need to squat down to regain sight. pls vsauce tell me what is happening pwease?
Mind blow
Thanks for making.
"I understand the question, as I've pondered it before, and I believe it helps. Not only in the context that it helps in figuring out the answer to the initial question, but it helps as a related bit of trivia. Knowing that deaf people can think without a voice and only visuals, a logical conclusion could be that deaf people don't think in words but just sights and things they've seen, like buildings or faces. They may not be able to express their thoughts in words, but that wasn't the question."
Sleep is a no-brainer  ZzZzZ
"dude, if your thinking about infants learning the language.. deaf or not... it is still nonsense for them... if youre talking about infants...wow ._."
How can i keep watching Vsauce if my mind is blown everytime?
Imagine how many people this guy could piss off with sarcasm.
This video did not mix well with my cheerios. Still a great vis as always though!
Your heart can still beat without a brain
they think in silence
I thought it was bad when I saw the cockroach and then the frog legs began to dance. If you need me I'll be in the corner crying.
Yes they think in sign language when they're born. Good job...
sign language... They literally think in sign language
"they are technically slightly different, mutations etc. if you tested their dna 100% you would see slight differences. but still they are just different versions of the same dna they are  based on the environmental impacts that they have had. in any case they are technically... the same person but  with their own personal thought and ideas.

@alex39mat i dnt think they have a language for them to think. if anything they think and dream using images/pictures

"What about jellyfish?

I would say if your cloned then the other you, is really a different version of say windows.. not better not worse but in any case it is you, just a slightly different version with different experiences etc"
I'd imagine they would just think in images.
"Oh no!

"no one thinks, truely, in language...we think in images, then convert to a language. It is done at the speed of lightening (literally). Therefore, it doesn't really matter the language. But we have to understand the language in order to convert to images, so a deaf person learns sign language, already an image language."
wait...what informations? where did i get those informations? So..me and the brain is not the same ME?

"I know his facts are right, but have you ever wondered that they could just make up a story and sell it so we believe it?"
"I sometimes argue with people that my thoughts aren't necessarily composed of different combinations of 26 letters. Language is merely a translation of our thoughts and frankly it's not a perfect translation. You can also ask - If a person is born blind, what do they see? Is it pure blackness? Or is it actualy ""nothing""... as in, what your elbow is seeing right now."

"spinal cords themselves can have a certain degree of intellegence. For example, they exibit some degree of neuro plasticity and can take over functions from the brain.

thanks to neuroplasticity, walking could prove to be a no-brainer."

This is the same philosophical idea behind abortion and killing live human babies in the womb people try to dehumanize it by calling them a clump of cells but I am still me even though theoretically I am just a bunch of cells!
Tthat picture of the cockroach made me drop my phone :(
You should do a video about what makes something fun.
"I'm sure it has to do with the addictive quality of working hard for something and getting rewarded for it. When rewarded for something our brains release a chemical called dopamine (I think?). Dopamine is the chemical that responsible for that good feeling after you've done something good for your survival like eating, procreating, or achieving a goal important to you personally. Achievement Unlocked: Dopamine"
There was a guy who was sentenced  to death by decapitation. So his friend told him to keep blinking for as long as he could. The man blinked for 19 seconds. Just imagine that. Weird right?
you're freaking me out man... like im really freaking out O.o
"Hey Vsauce! Just wanted to say you guys should do something with rigor mortis! As mentioned with the frog leg demonstration, humans and animals go through rigor mortis. The calcium that floods into the sarcomere of the muscle via T-tubules is unable to leave, thus causing the muscle to contract involuntarily and unable to relax. Interesting stuff if you think about it! Great video by the way keep em coming!"
"The same dead frog concept applies to the dancing soy sauce squid, right?"
Okay the dancing frog legs was an eyeopener - did not expect that
My teachers going to love this excuse for why I didn't do my homework.
"the... roach... 
*panic*"
"Hey Michael, i just want to know if it's possible to send oxigen and nutrients to the brain of a beheded head. ( And of course keep it alive !!!! ) Mwuuuhahahahahh! >:D"
"I stopped eating my cereal when he mentioned cockroach :(

This a very morbid video and now I am questioning my own mortality. Thanks Vsauce!
Simple...it's an addiction. You need to play. You can't do anything else if you haven't played in a while. It consumes your life. It may even destroy brain cells (who knows?). 
"This I already know why people play video games, I wanna know why I get ear worms though."

My mind went BOOM
Love your shows
Your videos ate very interesting and your style is entertaining. Thank you.
I each your videos a lot and I was wondering if u could tell me about dragons are they real or are they not ? Any way just a idea I learn a lot from our video
"Who needs a video when I can answer that question. People play video games, because they are really fun, not really. Video games are made to be addicting, Borderlands 2 is a perfect example. People love the feeling of leveling up, they feel as if they accomplished something something, people love gambling, people love looting, and people love customization. That's because Gearbox has exploited our human nature, that's morally wrong . Not all games are like this, but most (popular) are."
Maybe you didnt know the snap! noise doesn't occur with the friction of your fingers but when your middle finger makes contact with the base of your thumb.
"Can you do an episode on taste? Like, why do certain tastes taste like they do, why do some tastes like saltiness or sweetness taste better than things like sourness or bitterness with the general human race? Why does it taste more bland and sour when you eat something sweet right after something else sweet?"
Descartes First Meditations is Descartes philosophical view on mind vs body. Good read for a view to the philosophical question posed at the end
Ya why do people play video games???
the new youtube layout sucks.
Dude ur too cool
I LIKE TURTLES
this is so creepy. 
Descartes First Meditations is Descarted
Coulda been better :(
This was a really depressing video

I am so high ........
"we use 100% .... it's a oooold myth. google it.
Republicans probably use 10% tho"
It comes down to 2 things; It's either for the same reason people read books/watch movies OR it's because they're competitive. 
"Michael, I miss the music you used to end your videos with, for example, the music at the end of videos like 'This Is Not Yellow' (Flan by Jake Chudnow?). 

The music feels...right. It makes we feel as if I am in the Twilight zone. It makes me want to find answers, find worm holes, find... It makes me feel as if there is more to life than just watching youtube videos. It makes me feel as if there is still... 

Hope.

However, make videos as you think is right!

And as always, thanks for posting."
The frogs legs thing was kinda creepy...
i'm gonna throw up oh my god
"Clicking the LIKE and SUB button for me was a no-brainer, keep up the good vids"
Hi if you look at your comments I was wondering I you could do a video on how we only use 10% of our brain and what would happen if we used more??? Thanks.
I wish you were my science teacher.
I learned this in 7th grade -.- and 3&4
Errrrrrrrrrrrrrr

"I always find that metres per second is a more mind blowing measurement for how fast small things move, as 100metres/sec - relative to the size of a neuron, or even your body - seems much faster than a speed that's associated with large vehicles (i.e 400kilometres/sec), which is harder to imagine."

"Here's something interesting for you fellow vsaucers. About the heart being a 'No brainer', there are 3 different types of muscle reactions,
1. Voluntary muscles (actions like moving your arm)

3. Cardiac muscle, and the only thing in your body that is a Cardiac muscle in your heart :)

word.. that would be pretty interesting to learn about

I just shitted my pants.
Upload the background music for everybody to enjoy. Please and thank you.
"I think he should make a video about 2012 and what will ""happen"""

I was just thinking to myself that I really wanted to watch a new vsauce video :)
"Hit like before the video started... Love Vsauce
"
"It's ok, I'm sure all of us wondered that at some point. Thing is, when a video reaches 301-305 views, Youtube puts it through some sort of authenticity test, checking all the sources of the views, to make sure the video is not getting its views from illegitimate sources like bots, DDOS attacks, or something like that. 
Likes, however, keep counting regardless. Once Youtube makes sure the views are legit, the view count goes back to normal."
michle what the fuck the dancing froglegs was fucked up warn ppl about that fucked up shit ill have nightmares for week about that shit -undsubed

RAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!! you just fucked my mind
My brain hurts just thinking about this
You clearly haven't seen the video on why youtube view counters stop around 301.
The only channel where I get excited when I a new video
I love this guys videos
6:25 MINDFUCK!!
My brain is not me. I want to go to bed but my brain says watch youtube . Try to argue with my brain.
Hi.
You must be new here.
The music in the background is perfect brain music.
Man i have seen vVsauce videos since it started and now they have a third channel! one of my favorite youtubers.
What model of G-Shock was that?
I recall a Tedtalk where they hooked up a professional driver to measure brain activity and found when the car slipped he reflexively compensated without a spike in brain activity.  So wouldn't your reflexes also be a part of 'You'?
we actually live inside our brain
Funny..over 7000 likes and only 300 views-_-
"whats up with the background music?
"
EW FROG LEGS EW
His name isn't Vsauce its.... Oh my god
im learning! thank you vsuce 
6:38 is when the mindfucking becomes too intense.

that got real deep at the end there Michael. I love this channel its full of science i like and understand. unlike school

Hi! You must be new here.
Boring episode.
"Combined malicious signs, pale = illness, sharp teeth/weapons (many other signs) = predator, basically all fear is to prevent death. Fear of heights = falling to death, fear of dark = easy prey in dark."
Didn't Vsauce explain about something like this?  Noob.
i swear this guy gets sooooooooooo ripped to think of this shit xD
watch?v=oIkhgagvrjI
"It is not only more efficient but more precise! think of it this way: try to explain something using only images and emotions. Its quite difficult. Also your brain switches to language because its what you use all the time. When you are using a mode of communication constantly, you start thinking in that mode  (if you learn a new language and are completely immersed in it, its quite possible to start thinking in that language) because it's so familiar."
Ewwwwwwww

Holy shit dead frog legs!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I saw you talking about a brain on the science channel on dark matters I think:p!!
were you eating dancing frog legs?
this a great vsauce video in a while
The frog thing is disturbing
you think this is bad read incognito
Thumbs up if you the new youtube UI seems weird!
"I have a video idea. What is it that makes something scary to you, but not to others? What is it that determines if something is scary or not, and why does your brain perceive it that wat?"
Who else tried to snapp his fingers and didn't get it? :(
bOOORING
He needs to work on his segways. . . . . :/
Mindblown
"nice' I like it.
"
I snapped when I read this comment.
I was thinking about the Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz the whole time lol
I got a question too... are you joking?
Very good episode. Keep it up.
Total mind fuck
do not type no brainer on google and press i'm feeling lucky
A lot less then that
So like what causes different skin colour? Like how is soneome born black and another white and ect
this guy makes science interesting! 
Watching Vsauce is a no brainer 
@2:03 - Projectile spit!
"primal instinct or danger. You are protecting yourself from harm, and scary things are things that are potentially life threatening."
Ugh i don't like his watch
58 people have no brain 
An Earth...
Thankz for the violent imagery.
"oh cool, thanks for the answer (: do you know why we then swap over to thinking via language? Is it just more efficient?"
Make a vid on dreams!!
Michael has gone to deep!
"the should do one on smell, how it travels and what it is and stuff"
"no its because youtube wants to make sure the views are legit. if its less than 300 views thats an insignificant number but once it gets to 300+ they have to process it and the reason it goes beyond 300, by like 4 or 5, then freezes sometimes is because there might be a few views coming in at once before it gets to the 300 mark and the counter stops. i think vsauce actually has a vid on that!"
The frog thing was really disgusting...
2:34  *km/H? 
Vsauce: Why are things ugly?
4:25 you don't need wires.... You need Meth.
nice gshock!
"Do a youtube search for ""Baby with no brain"" "
"Great questions! 
To answer them; There is no highest number before infinity, as numbers go on forever so just keep adding digits to the biggest number and you have a bigger one.
and yes, our thought take place in our brains, which are in our head, so therefore you are correct, we hear our voices inside our head, because thats were your brain is."
"As always, thanks for making my brain think overtime lol."
does anyone know where Michael attended university? he seems very smart
I wonder whatd it'd be like to watch these videos high..
Why the green screen?
"Aren't the brain and the spinal neurones notified in parallel ? I mean the messages arrive to the spine before because... they're on the way, but don't the messages do continue the travel up to the brain while the reflex is happening?"
how do muscle cells retract
how strong is popeye really?
i found that out abit too late
"To answer your question, quite simply we would think to ourselves in a mixture of images and emotions. As in the thought ""Don't touch that fire, otherwise you'll burn yourself"" become an image of you touching a fire, tied with the emotion or feeling of pain. or for ""I want to eat pizza"" you'd see an image of pizza  and feel hunger.
I hope that answers your question :)"
i know right
"I saw a video of a little girl is Syria who had gotten her brain shot out of her head and died, and when they were driving off with her she did a ""reflex breath"". would have scared the crap out of me!"
no in Sunday school when we die our senses are taken not our body
one man could. but he die because he was able to do so due to a severe disorder that ended his life.
"So then my body its just flesh, and my head and brain is me? Pretty confusing"
I like this question! any insight?

What..?
me did not.
okay now this NEEDS to be an episode!!!
We've been talking about that in gifted class
"whoops i meant quadrilion, "
not even.
"Oh my goodness, the WORST and most DISGUSTING episode of Vsauce. And yet, of course, interesting."
OMG I LITTERALLY LOLED WHEN I SAW THAT!!!
"go to numberphile, they have a vid on that. In short, it is so that YouTube can check to see if views are valid or not. This is a big deal because people can get money for views so the views must be stopped and validated before they can be added on later."
Gosh why can't yo be ny teacher :(

The music made it a lot creepier than it needed to be.
probably your subcontions....... oh god that akward momment when you just cant figure out how a word is spelled grrrrrrrr. 
"haha Vsauce always make you know something,THEN HE FUCK YOU WITH A QUESTION XD"
we are learning about ATP in bio 
"Itching, also known as pruritus, starts with some kind of external stimuli, including bugs, dust, clothing fibers and hair. Like tickling, itching is a built-in defense mechanism that alerts your body to the potential of being harmed. In this case, it might be the potential of being bit by a bug."
"I think all the vsauce viewers should take a moment to say, ""Your welcome file watching!"""
"hey! Vsauce, Michael here... hey! Vsauce, Michael here... hey! Vsauce, Michael here... hey! Vsauce, Michael here... hey! Vsauce, Michael here... hey! Vsauce, Michael here...mix it up a little, please!?"
Here on youtube I saw a video about a baby that was born with no brains.  
i love vsauce.
Mind. Fuck.
The brain is the most important organ...according to the brain
"not true: 8th grade biology textbooks focus on cell reproduction, viruses and such. nothing to do with brain and what can be done without brain"
I love v sauce!!

I love where this has gone to ^_^
"I subscribed to Vsauce when my brother used a tendon hammer to quickly depress my biceps brachii tendon, which jerked and hit the mouse button just when the cursor was over the subscribe button. Since the reflex arc does not pass through the brain, it was literally a real no-brainer to subscribe to Vsauce (unless you count my brother's brain, that is). I guess you could call it an yes-spinal-corder if you want, though."
the placebo effect
"We get itchy for several reasons. First, because dust particles in the air attach to our body hair and irritate the skin. It also can happen because of a mental illness, some patients have been recorded where they constantly experience an itching sensation all over their body, though this is rare."
ive been meaning to ask that for sooo long!
very nice quality (that means that you can see his face clearly) <3
"Any number is before infinity, infinity never ends, so it's like the only number from 5 to 6 or 7 to 8. so basically, negative, decimal, or a whole number, it's just behind infinity."

This channel fucks with my brain.
Numberphile did a video on that. You should check them out.
"I love this episode. I love how the idea of action potentials generating via an influx of Na+ ions into the soma/cell body of the neuron is shown in a practical sense involving frog legs. To me, it's analogous to showing someone that water's structure makes it polar (has partial positive and partial negative charges) via rubbing bringing a negatively static charged balloon to a thin stream of water and causing it to bend towards it. Awesome video!"
"Every single time he says ""And as always..."" I still think he's gonna say ""Don't forget to be awesome."""

"neat, I'm gonna tell this body to do that poop thing now."
Just under the speed of light...
"there's no evidence for that. people give special powers and abilities to people they adore like da vinci, shakespeare, einstein or even stalin, kim jong-il or alister crowley and a lot of the stories (if not all) surrounding such people made up fairy tales."
well... that chicken story was sad.
actually have you ever heard that there are more bacteria on the surface of human skin than there are people in the world? i think thats y we get itchy
I believe a French scientist discovered the frog leg trick.

Research what you just said and find that you are wrong.  ONE group of chinese scientists found that they are faster then it was disproved by another FIVE groups of scientists.

FASCINATING. 
its a reaction from our body saying you have dead skin cells that you need to get off of your body.  Unless you have a rash or something then that's chemical stuff.

@soldeviljr So a living cockroach is where you draw the line? Not the skinned dead bodies of innocent frogs? Interesting.
"actually, At the physical moment, there is many many methods of speed that are faster than light. light is fast, but not as fast at a high mach level. We humans can't reach it, but it's still out there."
" Ah....Clever. Don't wanna go with the common answer, eh? But to nitpick...The question posed was ""how fast can things GET""? I'm going to interpret that question as asking for ""how close to the speed of light (in a vacuum ofc) can an object get?""... and thus we're looking at acceleration. :P

Nice V-neck.
"speed of light, in a vacuum :D"
actually it can get faster speed of light is not as fast as the speed of light in a vacuum this creates a sonic flash 
this is the internet! SCREW YOU!
"Actually, the speed of light varies depending on what material the light is passing through. C, a sort of speed limit for all energy in the universe (according to the theory of relativity). C is the speed of light in a perfect vacuum, which is 299,792,458 metres per second (186,282 miles per second)."

"You weren't even correct. It would be... A cockroach can survive a nuclear disaster. We learn this stuff in school... Oh wait, most of you didn't go to school. ""numbnuts""."
A cockroach may be able to survive a small nuclear disaster but only a small one. They are better at surviving radiation than we are obviously but a lot of the warheads we have now could easily kill off a cockroach. Even the one dropped on Hiroshima would have killed any cockroaches at ground zero. There are a lot insects that can survive much higher levels of radiation than a cockroach though. It seems your school lied to you and most of us went to schools that knew better.
speed of gravity.
things can actually be faster than the speed of light
5954 likes in 305 views? IS THAT SCIENTIFIC POSSIBLE?
just because you don't believe in god doesn't mean you get to make fun of who is.
"for particles with mass, velocity is asymptotal towards the speed of light. For massless particles, they travel at the speed of light. However, a theorized warp drive could compress spacetime in front of a spacecraft, and extend it behind the spacecraft, causing the spacecraft to appear to move faster than light without actually breaking the laws of physics."
"A recent study found out it is in fact possible to go faster than the speed of light, so stfu and be nice!"
Fap Fap FapFap
why does vsauce need three channels?? why can't we have all the videos on one channel? i wouldn't mind seeing more vsauce in my subscription box more often! :) 
Welcome to youtube sir.  Feel free to stay a while and explore.
Diggin' the new beats.
couldn't you live with only a head if scientiscs could quickly get a machine hooked up to you to pump blood and all that to your brain. 
Lmao i also liked before watching xD these vids are awesome
VSAUCE 3?!?!?! IM NOT EVEN GUNNA WATCH THE VIDEOS FIRST IM SUBING!!!!!
*are
Wow that's really cool! :D VSAUCE FTW! 
"I had that happen once, but with my lungs.
And it wasn't really me, my daemon had to pump them for me.

"What is somebody driving comes out of nowhere and out of nowhere you steer right of the way without realizing what you just did or why? is that a reflex, or a no brainer, because I think you'r brain has to tell you something."
okay that frog leg clip was kinda terrifying.... 
Learned about ATP today in bio class!!
I think you should do a video talking more about braindeath and how bodily functions still work post-mortem and stuff like that

"The evidence does suggest an actual physical phenomenon of the consciousness. However, this consciousness has yet to be experimentally found or categorized. This resides in the paranormal, occurrences of inconsistent phenomenon that have not been effectively studied or experimented in a fashion that rules out other lurking variables. But this physical anomaly, either a form/state of matter or some other, is probably the closest one thinks of when one thinks of a soul/spirit etc."

who the fuck dislikes Vsauce? 
"A sonic boom is created when air molecules are pressed up against the surface of a moving object faster than they can move away (because the object is going faster than sound). Thus, they keep building up pressure until they are released in a steady stream that is heard at any one point as a sonic boom.

But when light hits an atom, it is either absorbed or reflected, and photons are so small that one certainly could not push more than one atom, thus making a build up of air molecules impossible"
"Skin shrinking instead of hair and nails growing, wo, makes sense but didn't imagine that. Where are memories in your brain? I know there were some experiments where they removed parts of the brain that were active when a memory was being reviewed but afterwards they could still remember that memory, also we can sense things like when our phone is about to recover a text or call sometimes, is that some kind of IR perception?"
Amazing ol' Mike the Headless Chicken
you can go both ways with this argument and say there is no such thing as love just like there is no soul. either way its a weak argument 
I have seen ATO andenosine triphosphate reactions in decapitation videos its weird and crazy! :O

"An interesting thing about decapitated heads is that they may still retain some sort of electricity that allows them to carry out certain tasks. For instance, tell a person that's about to get decaptitated to keep blinking their eyes. After they've been decapitated, once you look at their head, you'll notice that their eyes will still blink for a duration of time until it shuts down because this was their last action that they remember before decaptitation."
This episode was a rather gross episode.

"you mean ""Klaus Störtebeker"" a pirate who lived in hamburg, he was promissed that every crew mate he would pass after being decapitated would be free'd. they got lined up and he walked 12 meters after his death he only fell because he tripped over a foot.

that's the legend anyway"

That frog thing isfucking scary
The next person that tells me it's a no-brainer is going to get slapped for their filthy lies.
theres a thrid channel askjfnc subscribes
I love this channel
"So let's see. I guess another example for involuntary process would be the body's natural response to protect itself. Take for instance, clapping your hands right in front of your face as close as possible. If done so, most likely your eyes would blink without your intention to do so. In this case, it would also require electronic stimuli. I wonder if there are any other examples other than random muscle spasms..."
I LOVE THESE GUYS!
......waht.
"wrong, throwing a ball while on a skateboard moving will not make it go faster. If you were riding on a skateboard at 20 mph per say, and you had a ball; now let's say you drop that ball. What would happen? Would the ball keep going at 20 mph till if came to gravity? Or would it fall straight down? It would fall straight down. Why? well Newton's law of gravity, and his 3rd law, every action has an equal or opposite reaction. "

What changed? Oo
"""On a related note, digestion..."" Yep makes complete sense cause the skin and digestion are very similar. I love Vsauce. "
daammm only if everyone watched vsause!!!!
"Hey Micheal, I have a suggestion! In lots of these videos, there are GREAT questions that everyone would love to hear you answer, but aren't grand enough to make an entire episode for. I think that you should make a segment at the end of every Vsauce video, explaining and answering one of those great questions people ask in the comments. Thanks, and I love you guys!"
"Hi, welcome to Youtube."
"For an episode about no brainers, it sure gave me a headache."

Ha my thoughts exactly (the comment below)
@Vsauce PLEASE MICHAEL BE MY SCIENCE TEACHER
in quran god said that killing of cutting your self is forbidden cuz you don't own your body . and that is like 1400 years ago 
"The whole ""is my brain me?"" question has always bothered me. If we could do the futurama head-in-a-jar thing is that still me?  Is it me the opposite way; an entire working body with no brain?  Freaky."
the frog legs are creepy as sh*t!
"come watch my videos , im a partner "

You have the most relaxing voice lol .!
This is one scary ass Vsauce video
Your moustache is thicker directly underneath your nostrils.

How do the bacteria in our digestive track get there?
So... Your telling me we cant turn to zombies if our brain is dead?...
"no, but a tin can"
I remember there was a man a while back who decided to study how long you stay conscious after being decapitated.  His work ironically enough got him sent to a guillotine in which he asked his colleague to look at his head when it was chopped off to see how many times it could blink before ultimately dying.  The man was able to blink 20 times showing the brain stays conscious around 20 seconds after decapitation.
"How is there only 305 views and 3,744 likes?? hmmm"
You have been deducted 10 internets. Back to your Corner!

Man. Michael gets so deep in this kind of stuff 0.0 I can't even imagine how a guy on weed or something reacts to this
"You've probably gotten 100 answers already, but here is the right answer:
Light always travels at the speed of light, regardless of the speed of the observer. This means that turning on your headlights, the light would travel away from you at the speed of light. If a stationary observer were to measure the speed of your headlight light, they would get that it was traveling at the speed of light too.

This is an extremely simple answer to a very difficult question, but I hope this helps! :)"
feeding a headless chicken for 18 months that's sick...
become my teacher. now. make school interesting.. please.
Cool story bro.

I want my 7 minutes back. Any 13 year old who has went to biology knows these facts.
shit
"That is a very hard question, Why, well newton said anything can go faster than the speed of light, theres nothing that special about it, but Einstein says that you cant, its actually really hard to explane with in 500 letters, so i recommend searching Michio Kaku on youtube. hes very good at explaining physics to young adults! good luck and i hope you find physics as exiting as i do."
"k, i have been curious about something and i hoping vsauce can explain it, How and why does the brain affect the body in response to emotions? for example heart throbbing because of loss of loved ones, crying when you're sad, smiling when you're happy, and yawning when you're tired."
Curious??
0:04 OR IS  IT!?!? -music plays-
"Michael, I saw you on a show on the Science channel (Ugh I think it was like Dark Matter or something), talking about a man who had to have his entire Hypocampus removed to stop his constant seizures, but it gave him short term memory loss. Just wanted to let you know. :D"
Paranoia has nothing to do with disgust...
amazing
I wonder if this is the answer to moving on to a greater being
what? a chicken without a head for 18 months!?!?!? MINDUFCK
I want Michael to be my Science teacher.
YEA VSAUSE
"Cool episode, but I was really hoping you'd talk about how he brain can stay conscious for up to 30 seconds after a beheading so people have been known to change facial expressions, blink on command, and other crazy stuff.  "

Thanks Vsauce"
"no there are three classes animals, plants and bacteria. only animals have brains."
MIND BLOWN!! But about the frog legs..if eventually they run out of adenisine triphosphate (ATP) or loss energy why can't there be a way to continually supply ATP or energy to that severed apendage?? I know eventually the legs will decay but with a constant stimulus shouldn't that keep the body functionally enough to jumpstart cell regeneration??
the cockroach looks liek a ppenis....

"Instead of a no-brainer for your skin cells, lets think for a second about what if your brain was like a general miles away from the battle field, and your skin cells are the soldiers. If the general dies and this is before modern technology, the next in command ""death"" would send a messager who it would takes days sometimes to reach the soldiers in the war about the general commands, ""to stop working and die"", then could your skin cells be doing the last command long after you brain is dead."

"Well from what i know there are no seeds in a wooden pickle so that action would be comparable to a 0 for time.

Also, since I don't know what a one legged paper hanger is but, assuming it's doesn't interfere with time such that it is able to slow down or reverse the flow of time to an observer, any such creature or thing performing an action that cannot be completed or even technically started I'd have to say it would take:

No time at all."

"I'm guessing you would have to be in front of it and moving away at the same speed, you would probably see the same car you saw when you started moving, even if it changed after. If you then stopped, apart from being crushed if you somehow survived travelling that fast, you would see what happened after you were travelling with it, so yes, you may be able to see the headlights ""on"" for a fraction of a second, but they wouldn't illuminate anything as it would crash into it at the same time. :/"

Sometimes I think they should change their name to Overthinksauce lol
"I don't think it would be a ""Yes-Brainer"" its not the answer to a question requiring a yes or no answer, its more of a with or without situation. No-Brainer, something not requiring your brain. A No-Brainer I suppose could also be called a Not-Brainer or Without-Brainer. I think it would be more fitting to call a Yes-Brainer just a Brainer  or maybe a With-Brainer."
"That is impossible because nothing can go faster then the speed of light. lets take your skate board analogy. if you were travelling 1 k/h less then the actual speed of light and you throw a ball, Time will compensate for the speed of the ball. relative to you, the ball would be travelling in slow motion, because time would not allow you to travel at the speed of light. i love physics and i asked this question to a prof before. its pretty interesting!"

"@ Vsauce While we're thinking about losing our heads: after you are decapitated, do you think it that you would still be conscience for a few seconds?  Just as a head?  Your eyes and ears and nose and mouth are all connected directly into the brain, aren't they?  And so is your sense of touch.  Even if for a few seconds, do you think you would still be coherent?"

Why do we randomley realize that we are breathing or walking? Does  our brain automatically refresh or something like that?

OR IS IT?
Whaaa so fascinating!
The light emitted from the headlights would just follow you since ur going at the exact same speed as the light

"Zombies actually can exist. Its caused by ingesting puffer fish venom. The venom causes the victim to go into a comatose state so that the heart is beating so slowly, it seems like the person is dead, but the mind is alert. When they can finally move again, the venom has damaged their brains so they can no longer speak except for maybe some grunts and groans. Also their walking is impaired so they walk with a limp of sorts. Because of their limited mobility, they can only perform small tasks."

why is the video just stopping at 7:17 for me?
Well goats are like mushrooms. If you shoot a duck I'm scared of toasters.
If i know right it would go the speed of light away from you in your perspective which you would think is going twice the speed of light but in actuality time for you is slowed down so much that the light would move away from you the speed of light and for an observer outside of the cars system would measure you and the light going the same speed. Someone correct me if I'm wrong please!
